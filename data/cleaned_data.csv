2,I didn t know how to phrase the question so I will try to clarify my F brother m has been drinking since he was but it has slowly gotten worse We have a long history of alcoholism in our family and I have even felt like I like it way too much when I do drink When he drinks he really becomes a different person he gets aggressive he punched a door down because I woke him up or he just falls asleep for hours Last year his high school sweetheart broke up with him after he fell asleep for the millionth time and woke up at pm on a day when they were meant to go on vacation At the time I thought she was unreasonable but in the last year I have realized that whenever we hang out he brings a flask and passes out on my couch for hours He tells me he will stop but he doesn t my mom finds empty bottles in his room weekly I just don t know what to say anymore he has seen so many of our family members die over this and I just want some advice on how to ask him if he needs help without him feeling like I just don t understand ,What would you have wanted your sibling to say when they noticed there was a problem with alcohol ,1

12, I m a year old male my sponsor has me on step ten as of last night I ve been in a rocky relationship with my girlfriend who isn t in the program and isn t one of us We ve been together about eight months however I ve been very unhappy with our relationship and have tried breaking up with her at least times so far It never goes well She has tried to leave me stranded in an unfamiliar town up in the mountains of Nederland Colorado which is hours away from where my family lives somewhere I had never been to before after a disagreement and argument I ve also witnessed some personality changes in her and when she gets angry I am frightened of and for her Further complicating matters she has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and has survived cancer before years ago She also was a victim of child sexual abuse when she was a minor she is now Her family are dysfunctional too After describing my relationship with her to a very close friend of mine in the program he told me that I m in an abusive relationship emotionally and mentally based on the things I told him and strongly recommended that it might be in my best interest to leave her There are other reasons I want to leave too but it feels difficult though my heart tells me that this relationship is no good Is there a way to tenth step this Shituation ,What Is Step And How Can I Apply It In This Situation ,1

14,I ve been a social drinker since I was of age and slowly but steadily have gotten more intertwined with alcohol in recent years It started becoming more of a thing when my grandmother died years ago and ramped up a bit more when I started living alone a couple of years later and then again during Covid I know that I drink more that most maybe all people I know but up until lately I ve dismissed this because I haven t really let it affect my work or social lives A couple of weeks ago while drunk I looked up AA meetings near me for the first time ever I came up with excuses to talk myself out of actually going at that time I ve been thinking about it again the last couple of days I think my biggest hurdle right now is that I m almost sure that even if I go to a meeting I will mess it up and fall back into drinking fairly quickly and I hate to fail I know that many don t succeed their first try at sobriety but my brain is still having a problem with this thought As I get to this point in my writing I am not really sure what I was looking for with this post but I m going to post it anyway even though part of my brain is taking me to just delete this nonsense and see what happens ,Not sure if I m ready for this ,1

18,Ive tried on my own to quit drinking and obviously thus far it has not been effective I feel that I really need a friend to either go to meetings with me virtually online or maybe someone to check up on me discuss things I realize that the easy answer is to go to a meeting and get a sponsor but thus far I have not managed that social anxiety excuses I am trying to determine in my own life who might be an appropriate person to ask My partner definitely not Sober friend that Ive discussed meetings with before maybe Healthcare provider friend that really seems to want to help maybe Other I feel as though a person I have a pre established connection with would be ideal although perhaps more complicated I don t want to add things to anyones life that they don t have the space for Thoughts TYIA for your help sorry for the ramble ,Need help who to ask ,1

21,Not sure who else to talk to so here goes My wife and I are looking at having kids in the next months or so but I m really concerned about her relationship with alcohol I ve walked in on her in the kitchen a few times just super drunk out of nowhere Like glassy eyes swaying for balance can t get coherent words out drunk Which in itself is annoying but not a total deal breaker since there s a lot about her that I love really deeply But still I find her unattractive when she s in that state What worries me is when I ll ask her about it she ll say she didn t drink anything Also I never actually see her drink so I m pretty sure she s hiding it Which isn t a good sign Still the evidence is there All the once full bottles in the liquor cabinet are empty and I haven t been drinking anything over the last few months Plus there are some half empty fifths in the garage that I don t remember getting So clearly someone in the house is drinking and it s not me Just the two of us live here So I think she s drinking in secret and drinking a lot at times Still it s not a daily occurrence Where I worry is that she totally denies this and denies the idea that she might have a problem drinking I ve learned not to bring this up and she is totally confident she won t drink during pregnancy or with small children around But I ve learned I can t believe anything she says or promises about her drinking So I don t know what to do here Basically I m worried I ll end up watching my wife hurt herself and our future child with her drinking but at that point it will be too late to avoid this scenario I don t know how to discuss it with her Since we re both I feel like there s a little bit of a ticking clock here in terms of addressing her drinking and starting a family But ultimately I would rather have kids safely without her than with her if she doesn t won t acknowledge this issue She has a lot of trauma from her mom s drinking when she was a kid dad s a recovering alcoholic too but hasn t drank in years She HATES the idea of therapy and says that s not how I process things But she gets weirdly emotional when talking about family stuff so I feel like she hasn t so much processed as repressed these issues I think she has some self worth self love issues around this that aren t getting better with age As I understand it direct confrontation isn t the way to deal with alcoholism because the sense of shame just leads to more drinking So really any advice on any of this would be good Fuuuck I m stressed ,Wife s Drinking,1
22,On Sunday I had to go to a family party cousin is joining the military and left Monday I was at fifteen days sober on Sunday and feeling pretty anxious about all the alcohol that would be there and be pushed on me I called my sponsor on the way there and one of her suggestions was to do acts of service while I was there So I said I could do that I get there and the food was already handed out so I lost my opportunity there I got myself a plate and sat down and ate The band is playing and my uncle starts throwing my second favorite tequila all over the dance floor and the people dancing and then pouring tequila into their mouth The urge to drink was unbearable so I decide to help clean up Im grabbing the dirty plates and my aunt asks me what im doing I tell her I m cleaning up she tells me not to worry about it I tell her I want to help Well my uncle hears and tells me I can help make drinks So im helping pouring shots making mixed drinks putting Tajin and like into beer And all i can think is God you sick son of a gun you think you re funny ,Higher power has a sense of humor,1

27,I relapsed last weekend after about days sober Absolutely shocked at how quickly I blacked out I was away for the weekend in a different city and found myself separated from my group and staggering the streets with a broken phone looking for how to get back to my friends house Somehow found a cab that took a credit card and I made it back in the wee hours The lack of recollection for a multi hour period scares the heck out of me I could have fallen stepped out into traffic been arrested for public intoxication etc Part of me doesn t even want to reach out to folks to see how I was acting at the bar before getting separated I guess I just need to thank God I survived and commit to meetings in days Each time I pick up it is rush and roulette and with a family and great career there is way too much at stake ,Day ,1
28,So being together with someone who has drinking problem is a roller coaster years of tending to them and little by little pulling them away from their life of running Watching as they had trouble coming to terms with confronting their issues because the alcohol was always their solution instead of facing it head on They grew so much and started finding stability Fought me tooth and nail about going to meetings and after they got so far they always ended up sabotaging themselves It was fight after fight over the Golden rule and their understanding of it was very self serving It always came down to some from of slavery because issue came if I had any kind of freedom and if they did itlit was not supposed to be a problem Contact fights of making it be know that if they didn t like the way I was return the treatment given to me then it wasn t okay in the first place and shouldn t have been done to me Things would get better then fall apart in a repetitive cycle Some fights were bad with shoves and yelling but this last one they got violent and then intentionally broke a window Came back from a friend s birthday party to see they relapsed and were so depressed Thought I would hate them but I didn t I simply wanted them out of the car inside safe and sound so we could resolve this issue with a clear mind after rest it didn t go that way and I had to throw them out I can t get the feeling off of me that I hurt them even though I was hurt by them but when they came back to get their belongings it was like talking to a lost child not sure why they did what they did and on the verge of begging for forgiveness I don t feel I should give in because if I do again they will never understand that their actions have consequences because giving them a get out of jail for free card allows them to believe they can get away with it here and there I guess I just wish everything was different that that alcohol never caused them or anyone this sort of chaos and lack of control If they had never had that problem I don t think things would have gone to these extremes but I do hope that they truly will grow from this and that instead of harming them that this will help them finally fight to save themselves They don t need to stop drinking forever but that they don t need to drink today ,Relationship with an alcoholic,1

34,WARNING This post contains harsh criticism of Abrahamic Monotheistic Belief Systems Hello I M am an addict I went to my first step program today and am very glad I did It was an AA meeting at the university I am currently attending and although I am not an alcoholic the leader of the program said it was okay if I attended the meetings I abuse marijuana and wax concentrate I am planning on reaching out to the leader of the meeting and asking him to help me with making a commitment to my sobriety After the meeting he told me that the best thing I can do for sobriety is ask God to help me The problem is that I do not necessarily believe in God They told me that all religions can do AA and the step program even an atheist The problem is I am not an atheist I believe it is very possible God is real I just have no interest in God or prayer Even if I were to consciously admit that God is real I genuinely do not have anything to say to him The way I see it putting my faith in God is pointless and naive It doesn t matter if God is real because he isn t here now and he isn t going to protect me from anything I know this because I have seen life at the bottom not personally but I have read and seen so many horrific things at this point that I refuse to believe God has a plan for us There are so many people who don t really get to live out that narrative people born with terrible malformations and diseases little girls kidnapped and kept as sex slaves Saudi warchild born to drug addicted homeless parents etc Some people are born with zero hope or chance for anything but misery or suffering The idea that nothing is hopeless and that there is some great plan is nothing but a complete lie Humanity has conjured mythology to cope with and live in denial in face of the unbearable and awful reality actually is sometimes Some people don t get chances and there is no amount of prayer that will bring them salvation I think that the belief in God is one of humanities greatest mistakes As long as we believe God will solve our problems then there is no motivation for us to become desperate to save ourselves from REAL tragedy horror not some theoretical afterlife That being said my greater power is community I am stupid naive hopeless and ignorant and so is mostly everybody else However the community of my people is immeasurably greater in value and smarter than myself When I am lost arrogant and useless I can count on the community of my people that has upheld for thousands of generations and contains wisdom and elders I can seek guidance from To me that is real authentic and effective I do not think I will ever start praying until I am on my deathbed or in a foxhole and even though I admit that would probably happen in such case I feel as if praying now would be lying to myself and I cannot honestly admit to the group or my mentor that I have sought out God because I rejected God already and have chosen a different higher power as the object of my step program I guess I am just trying to figure out how I can get all of this across to a guy that thinks God is responsible for literally every event in the universe Without just telling him I think he is absurd and wrong TLDR I want to do the step program but I refuse to integrate God into my belief system How do I stay honest about this without offending my AA leader and group without offending anyone or getting off topic ,How to talk about my religious beliefs without offending the group mentor ,1

42,I quit days ago with the intention of quitting forever Now I can t say I was an alcoholic and my drinking habits were in the healthy range But my liver started hurting after a day of drinking I don t exceed drinks per day and each drink is fl oz of beer also I have a day in between rule So I said that enough is enough I m going to stop forever starting with a to really destroy the habit But now doubts are creeping in my mind Hey what if I drank right now and completed the day challenge with me cheating only once After the day challenge I promise I ll drink just once a month Maybe I haven t felt enough pain but I feel like it s not so bad if I only drink once a month Now if you ever quit alcohol don t ever come back This isn t me trying to suggest anything I had a pretty bad happening with alcohol a few years ago but aside from that I ve just drunk with moderation This is just me asking your opinion on my approach I know I have sufficient willpower to pull the day rule but I m not sure I was so happy at the thought that I will never drink again but I don t think that thought is realistic for me Again if you did quit don t listen to a word I say I have a lot of willpower but sometimes I wish there was someone here that would slap the stupidity out of me ,Quit But Feel Like Drinking Again ,1

44,Everyone at AA is very gung ho about fellowship always saying everyone should always come When I was new on my very second day of sobriety a particular group at a particular meeting was going out to eat for fellowship afterward I had raised my hand for a sponsor and a few remembered I had gotten my hour chip at another meeting the day before so lots of them stopped to talk to me afterwards and told me I should definitely go It was very friendly and kind and I was willing to do anything in the beginning so I went Being there was a different story A few talked to me for a moment at the beginning but that conversation quickly fizzled out and everyone naturally segregated into their own smaller groups of their pre existing friends I tried chiming in a few more times but struggled to actually get into a conversation of any length This one bit right next to me said ONE WORD every time I talked to her until I gave up Hate her til this day They all just talked about people things that they knew and I didn t I tried my best to stay open and calm as opposed to socially anxious and I did not take out my phone Overall I did not like this experience I don t claim to be some amazing conversationalist so I m not saying it s even all their fault But I felt stupid for agreeing to go to fellowship when no one really wanted to talk to me even when I was a raw hours sober And forget about now that I m months and not new anymore I WOULD absolutely go to fellowship with my home group or if a friend I knew was already there But the whole definitely go thing is bullshit I think if you tell a new person to go to fellowship you kind of have to at least talk to them most of time while they re there if they re obviously sitting quietly alone left out of everyone s conversations ,Problems with fellowship,1

54,I am f And I guess I don t know where to start so a Reddit post seems ok I grew up with an alcoholic Mum My Dad left us brother now when we were very small The truth is I don t know when this happened my childhood is a blur maybe this is the wrong Reddit thread My dad left us he walked away when I was small and we always believed Dad was the problem My Mum was crazy I feared for my life because of the fights We lived with Mum We didn t see Dad It s only now I m realising that my mum was the problem I get severe flashbacks Moments of torture and screaming crying desperately trying to understand Haunting memories of violence As an adult I m now more understanding my mum drank My dad didn t He s in London now amp has been for the last years I live with my mum She s an alcoholic and as I grow older I realise that my childhood was blurred by her drinking habits I picked her up when she was drunk I cleaned her sick I called an ambulance at yo when she passed out my friends were embarrassed by her drunken antics My family took me in my mum chose the bottle my dad didn t want to know I m here because I am a child of an alcoholic who believes she s cured I m here because I don t know how to process my childhood I m here for help ,I am an adult but a child of an alcoholic parent ,1
55,Sooo I m almost now I ve been drinking extremely heavily anywhere from beers a night every night for years now while I was drinking approx a year into it I started having pain in my right side near the rib cage area slight shakes gross floating stools always diarrhea that were commonly if not always pale in color still ate well still do I went to the doctor and they told me my levels were really high for my liver I was able to stabilize those levels by cutting down really paying attention for about a month Eating smoothies daily eating beats and beat supplement taking milk thistle you name it But of course I fell back into old habits about months ago my blood pressure was regularly about which I knew was related and caused me to be very hazy irritable and no ability to relax at any point I am on meds now which help a lot with that I am above normal for what it used to be because of the meds More recently I ve had a real big wake up call within myself my two kids being my motivation and started drinking maybe beers a night significantly cutting down with a end goal of beers a week at max spaced out every other night My overall health feels much better I have more energy increased appetite no pain in my right side if I do it s not noticeable maybe less energy than usual but still a significant increase But my stool is still considerably pale but no diarrhea My end question here is with this drinking habit and current conditions mentioned above how fucked is my liver I can finally see the end of the tunnel and am having a lot of hindsight which makes me ask these questions If you have any questions ab current state of health or when I was drinking excessively please do ask id be happy to answer ,Little worried ab liver issues or irreversible disease any insight ,1

58,Hello I m not an alcoholic but I recently baked a few pies using a pie crust recipe which includes vodka and later realized that one of my dinner guests who I don t know very well personally is a recovered alcoholic whose been sober for a few years now I really need some advice from people who are more knowledgeable What should I do It s way too late to make a separate dessert at this point should I just inform the person privately and let them make their own decision Maybe I can text his gf and ask what desserts he likes and go out and buy something else Is it okay to eat foods cooked with alcohol if the flavor of the dish is not affected at all From my research it seems that in a blind baked crust like this there would only be tsp alcohol left in the entire pie at the end of the process at most I feel like a jerk for overlooking this but what s done is done and I just want to handle it correctly from this point I feel pretty uncomfortable asking him directly because I hardly know the guy but if that s what I have to do I ll do it ,Baking with alcohol need advice,1

80,I really need help Has anyone heard of an individual being obsessed with drinking everything to do with it the fact that you re a drinker the fun of learning about different glassware other accessories drinking the alcohol disliking the thought of you not being a drinker etc but ultimately every time the person drinks no matter how much probably has Alcohol Intolerance they get sick whether it s just nausea or full blown throwing up This has been occurring for about years The person can stop consuming alcohol for long periods but still has the obsessions about it Most recent step away from alcohol was for a little over a year They did not try to sneak alcohol or drink in secret But I m assuming when the obsession of it got too strong asked if it was ok if they gave drinking another go I just learned about this truth so I said ok because I didn t really think they had a problem This was all admitted to me a few days ago So despite it making him sick at low quantities and high he would still continue to drink and if didn t throw up naturally he will make himself throw it up I know he needs helps but is this alcoholism or more of an OCD thing or something else Obviously it s very self destructive I could you use the insight and support If anything needs to be explained better please ask Thank you for listening and thank you for any help in advance ,Obsessed with drinking even though it only makes you sick ,1

82,I ll start by saying everyone I ve ever met in AA has been very kind Unfortunately however I m struggling to find a sponsor who ll just go through the steps with me as they appear in the book I understand the importance of meetings and I m not particularly averse to them I am averse to the quantity that s being pushed onto me I m shy I find them draining and I know in my heart that in would wear me down to the point that I d be in real danger of drinking It has happened before I can tell when I ve been to too many meetings because I get thrown off kilter and my mental state goes west The thing is I don t know where to meet a potential sponsor but at a meeting And everyone I encounter seems to be of the meeting makers make it school which just isn t true and definitely isn t appropriate for me I ve read the book and nowhere in it does it say anything about inhaling meetings I m ready to turn this shit over to God I want to do the steps I strongly believe in the idea of one alcoholic talking to another but everyone I talk to keeps pushing this over complicated narrative that s not part of the program and it s honestly just confusing the hell out of me I know I don t have to take these suggestions about going to meetings but I think I d find it difficult to work with a sponsor whose only solution to any given problem is to go to an absurd number of meetings and call an absurd number of people who will give the same advice Just to be clear I m not going to stop going to meetings Meetings are good and I m not opposed to meetings as a suggestion just the suggestion of literally hundreds as a magical cure all Also power to those for whom in works I m just not interested in it I m sorry that this was very long winded but I would appreciate any suggestions you have to offer on how to find a sponsor who d appreciate this or even just how to sensitively lay down to a meeting pusher that I want to do it how the book says without the additional stuff that I don t find necessary or helpful ,Sticking to the Program in the Book,1
83,After at least a year of fighting and delaying going to AA I finally went I ve been to about Zoom meetings so far I ve been working the first step and it has been quite the experience For the first time in years I sat down and wrote a list of how much chaos and destruction alcohol has caused in my life Many emotions that have been covered with alcohol are resurfacing and I m learning to deal with these emotions the best way I can I knew I had a problem for years I would sometimes joke about it to cover up how I truly was feeling When people would talk to me about their concerns I would yell at them That was until someone finally convinced me to go I didn t yell I didn t cuss her out I simply said OK and I picked a date to go Same person sent me a text the night before the selected date to remind me to go Even though I was aware I had a problem I didn t realize how much the bottle had me in its grasp till I started going to meetings and wrote down that list It s been a rough but healing week I m aiming for meetings in days and will continue to go after the days is up Lord bless the woman who finally got me to go ,New to AA and it has been an emotional but healing journey so far ,1

91,I have been through in my opinion minor things Cheated on but feel like I m forced to stay even though I still love her Made to feel like I was going crazy when it was all happening I d point something out we d talk about it That would turn into a majer argument and it would end with me being the ahole Feel like I m forced because she says if I leave she s going to kill her self Now she says that if I leave then she won t leave the house That she has to stay for the kids and accuses me of not loving them because I want to break up the family I really can t talk to anyone because she got on me about talking to friends and family about my issue when I found out she was cheating I was basically trying to get help from close ones but she made me feel bad because they shouldn t know our personal business Also when I ve talked to her she has come back and said I complain to much I m only trying to make people feel bad for me and that I m just having a pity party So now I kinda refuse to talk to anyone about anything Manipulated by my mom now that I look back at my childhood Well I think it s manipulation she said she would kill herself if I ever acted like my brother and dad Witch mainly ment if I was mean to her since that s how she said they would treat her May or may not have been touched as a child I feel like it s just a nightmare now when I think about it I m confused if it actually ever really happened I have never really drank as much as I do now Did drugs smoked weed and drank at a young age but it s never got this bad till after the pandemic I know well think those could be some causes but feel like people have gone through worse and never went this route My mental state isn t really all that good but for the reasons listed above I don t really have the will power to talk to anyone Now that I m writing this I m kinda scared my wife will look through my phone and see the post Then make me feel like an ahole because I told reddit this then go on about how she ruined my life That s what usually happens I kinda see it as manipulation but when I brought that up to her of course she made me feel bad I can t remember how because of course i was drunk Even though I was drunk i do remember the feeling of it being my fault This is kind of a rant at this point but it feels good to get it off my chest For anyone who s wondering I drink drinks a day Witch are alcohol because I can get a buzz faster Again for anyone who s wondering the cheating happened about years ago Since then though she texted my best friend about things that shouldn t have been talked about between my bf and wife She proceeded to lie about it till I got some of the truth from him That happened years after she cheated Then recently she texted a friend of mine that I told her I didn t want her texting privately I had accuses to her messanger and would go and read there convos Fucked up yeah I know Anyway I asked her not to privately text him Just so happen to find out they were texting and yeah it wasn t just friend talk either That s about the year mark witch happenedabout months ago So kinda seems like a trend Anyway back to my question I really feel like that has nothing to do with it Maybe it does and I just can t see it since I feel like a shit father husband and man Maybe I m just using all that as an excuse to be an alcoholic ,Hi my name is cheaterslove and I m an alcoholic My question is is it weird to know you re an alcoholic but don t know why ,1

118,Recently I was told by a member of the program I trust that was Malipulative The exact quote was wow your malipulative And its got me doing some deep reflecting on it and I am not sure the word she used fits correctly So I am looking for added perspective to fully recongize this defect of character and work on it Here is the full story On Monday I had planned to head up to clean the club prior to the meeting that we have AA meetings at I post on Facebook when I do so so those who wish to stop in can and that there is someone there if they should need them I care little about my Anonymity One member of the fellowship called me and asked if I could pick him up and he would help me clean Now this was a voicemail and I at first was only going to pick him up because it was the right thing to do not that I wanted to Then I realized that if I picked him up he would get tired after a few minutes of cleaning make an excuse then leave and then he wouldn t attend the meeting So then I became happy to pick him up and did so Now I pick him and he immediate remembers some errand he needs to run and I drop him off at the errand and he says he will meet me at the club when he is done to help I get to the club and I clean He gets there right when I have two things left to do vacuum and santizing chairs I ask him to vacuum since I wanted to make sure the chairs were santized correctly He vacuums for a few minutes breaks the vaccum then starts another cleaning activity Then after the cleaning activity which was only a few minutes he states he needs to go and I run him home I get back and the st person for the meeting his arrived while I was gone I tell her the rundown of what started as me explaining where I was It was still pre meeting but during the given time for fellowship but turn a little into a venting session Me explaining running this person to the errand then him breaking the vaccum and making the excuse to leave Then me saying how I knew he was going to do that when I picked him up After that I got the response that I am malipulative Which of course I was defensive about at first but a little confused since I did nothing to change the outcome I am not sure if Malipulative fits I certainly have an defect here as I should never me happy that someone isn t attending a meeting I am chairing I have at least identified why I didn t want this person at the meeting This person has mental illness that makes it hard for him understand inappropiate behavior and there is some boundry issues with him and women Which Mondays meeting is majority women I feel like I have to be on guard when he is there to make sure his behavior is in check so he isn t making any of the ladies uncomfortable ,Looking for perspective on a Defect,1

133,READ THE AA LITERATURE DON T TAKE ADVICE FROM STRANGERS ONLINE OR IN THE ROOMS OF AA UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT WHO IS AN ALCOHOLIC AND WHO IS THERE FOR OTHER REASONS AA is full of religious not spiritual zealots who want to take control of your life The only thing a sponsor is for is going through the steps AA literature suggests strongly that sponsors let sponsees go back to the groups ie leave them alone after working the steps As a side note for new people be very careful in AA Todays AA meetings are mostly street drug users Cousins to alcoholics as our literature states but we should not be telling them they are members of AA Criminal behavior comes with the street drug life it takes a hell of a lot to get off most drugs than it does booze so the bigshot AA ers telling drug addicts their in the right place are killing addicts and killing AA Pick your meetings vet your friends in AA Our groups in the last years have had everything from members robbing members a bunch of sexual assaults on new women one shooting in the parking lot dead and assorted felonies and misdemeanors To all you spiritual people who will trash my comments you would know about this stuff because the AA Grapevine official magazine of AA is finally printing stories about this problem but there were less than subscriptions to the Grapevine back in so most people will never see these Anyone tries to take over your life in AA or pressure you into anything tell them to take a hike AA published a yellow card for meetings in on criminal behavior but most groups won t read it it hits too close to home The reason for the warning card is AA New York has been named in a bunch of lawsuits mostly by women assaulted by other members This is not a new story it goes back to Mr Wilson example in sobriety There a a lot of alternative today too there may be a last house on the block but AA isn t it Working on fourth decade I ve seen it all and you were warned Suggested reading My Name Is Bill Susan Cheevers good history of AA warts and all ,A SERIOUS WARNING FOR NEW PEOPLE IN AA,1

137,Hi there I have been drinking in the last years on a daily routine around liters of beer a day six pack sometimes more In the last two years my girlfriend encouraged me to stop drinking and made me understand that I might have a problem and I started to reduce the amount of days a week that I was drinking until I reached days a week Yet after sometime I just returned drinking as I used only this time days a week and not Half a year ago I stopped for a bit but I didn t think it s a big deal my consumption amount so I went at it again The last couple of months I started to wake up every day with the fear of ruining my health and that soon I ll do non reversal damage to myself but at the end of each day I felt like it s still not the time for me to stop and that I ll do it in the future And then days ago I bought myself beers half a liter each planning to have a night drinking with myself but then my friends went out and I joined them I had beers with them and went home and drank the entire beers I bought earlier The morning after I felt like shit and the realization that continuing this way will soon lead me to ruin my health if I didn t do it by now It was Thursday morning that I decided to stop cold turkey I told doctor about it and she sent me to do blood tests a few days later and it seems I m ok and I haven t reached that point yet It s now hours since I did the blood tests and even though I m ok I didn t went back in to drinking because well the anxiety I had about the damages I might have done to myself are very hard to forget and moreover I don t want to risk my health The withdrawal symptoms and the struggle I had to overcome in these days are obviously another story and this post is long enough by now so I will not expand about it I m here because I really need an advice I got engaged two days ago and all of my friends want to go out with me and celebrate my parents wants me to come and raise a toast with them I haven t told anyone in my workplace that I got engaged because I m afraid they will also want to go out and celebrate which means me drinking This pressure is really hard on me I know for sure I cannot attend to all of this events but to go out with my friend and celebrate is something that I want so much I m considering to go out with them to celebrate and to drink in that single occasion but I m really afraid that it will open the door for my old ways on one side I don t see the harm in drinking with them once which leads me to think maybe I can occasionally drink only when I go out Like I m really new at this and I don t have anyone to talk with the people around me know I drink a lot but since I m only drinking beer and only after pm they don t consider me alcohol abuser I will be happy to receive some advice, days sober need advice,1

144,Good morning As the title states I am days alcohol free As I ve been doing the steps with my sponsors I ve noticed some things about myself and my relationships There has been a lot of growth and I am really happy Early in my sobriety I struggled I grieved alcohol Today I am not Today I think I am grieving something new What my relationship used to be like with my parents Our relationship is changing as I go through the program I don t want to participate in negative talk and gossip about others I want to be positive and ask God to take away my defects step is where I am at I noticed the last time I spent time with my parents my mom snapped at me for something very small Just your regular run of the mill passive aggressive manipulative behavior I found it hard not to go back to old responses Stand up for myself My dad tried talking to me about something I didn t want to gossip about My response was I don t care I felt bad I was beating myself up and feeling down about my response to my father That it wasn t positive and I didn t participate in his shit talk I shouldn t feel bad because I don t want them to control me or make me feel like I m bad mouthing everything I just feel like I m having to say goodbye to something and it feels like a loss Like I m grieving I think that is what I am feeling I want to figure this feeling out not feel bad about it nor feel guilty I feel guilt used to be my go to Anyone else struggle with their relationships changing and feeling loss after becoming sober , Days alcohol free and going through grief I think ,1
145, f I know I should maybe bring this up in a meeting as well and have also talked to my sponsor about it but it s still gnawing at me I m not very close with my extended family This mainly stems from a point of being abused by a cousin for an extended time when I temporarily lived with my grandparents I didn t feel like my aunts cared about me or wanted to protect me This has spawned some resentment as an adult and I honestly can t stand to be around them or any of my cousins for that matter My grandma s health started rapidly declining about a year ago According to my mom my aunts cancelled her life insurance policy and they ve been mismanaging her funds while she s been hospitalized for the last year Essentially there really is no money to bury her and my mom has been trying to save as much as she can now so that she can at least have a decent funeral My mom is a very emotionally needy person and this has really thrown her over the edge I currently live with her and I honestly have been no help at all I ve been sober for about four months now but for the last six weeks I ve been spiraling through this very deep depression I do the bare minimum to be functional most days which is just to make it to work and survive the work day That s it I haven t really been able to step up and be more responsible with helping out like I was during my grandfather s last days and i feel bad about it but I was drinking a lot then and stuffing my feelings which I m not doing now To make a long story short my mom wants me to travel with her out of state to visit my grandma and assist with possibly getting her established in hospice There is really no one else she can ask to help her and I just feel like emotionally I can t do it I can t be supportive to her I can t be strong now Not drinking and trying to get a foothold in my step program has felt hard enough I m not sure what to do and every time she talks about the situation I get so overwhelmed Just looking for some strength hope and experience in regard to this ,Afraid visiting my dying grandma might spark a relapse,1

151,I m a yo university student in the U K I ve been drinking for a fair few years and have always been known as the drinker of the group When lockdown started like others I started drinking more it got to the point I was drinking every night and weekly was drinking about litres of vodka I kept putting it down to uni experience but I genuinely cannot refuse a drink and every time I try to stop it s like an urge telling me that just one won t hurt I live at home and mostly drink at night when everyone else is in bed I m usually myself during the day because of covid so if I have a hangover or want to have a day drink it s easy for me to do so but it s always at night when I feel a real urge I go out every week with my friends I think my body is getting tired of drinking as I was sick twice which has never happened to me before the next day I nearly passed out and yet I still drank The following day I was sick times in hours I decided to come off drink for the week Last night I struggled not to drink I ended up just going to sleep but tonight I caved and had drinks I had water and food after but I actually feel vile like I m going to be sick As I said I drink every night I always start before am and usually stop whatever time I feel tired at The amount of drinks range from about ish maybe I noticed none of my classmates drink as much as I do and I m starting to get concerned I did notice that my drinking was starting to get out of hand but again I put it down to uni experience which I now don t think that s the case The earliest I ve had a drink is am before an exam about April time it was tequila I drank vodka for the rest of the day but that s about the only time I ve did something like that I used to paint all the time I loved it so much but I stopped because I was drinking so much during lockdown I was drunk every night I want to cut back drinking but when I try I really struggle to I try to distract myself but I keep thinking about how much better it would be if I had a drink whilst doing it I m really embarrassed and don t want to speak to anyone I know about this which is why I m asking peoples opinions on here Idk if this is the start of a problem but if so I need it stopped now before it gets worse Do you have any advice How can I distract myself from alcohol ,I think I might have a drinking problem and I m not sure what to do,1

155,This is more of a health question and although I don t expect medical advice I m just curious if anyone else has experienced similar FWIW I m lbs I used to be a tank maybe over time I can t nearly drink as much and I got super sensitive I figured it out but still drank often I m the frat boy of my friend group everyone associates me with a great time the guy who forces everyone to do shots I never used to get hangovers I used to be a completely high functioning alcoholic About a year ago I started getting rapid heart rate anxiety things I ve never experienced before in and out of drinking Prior to last year I never had a panic attack ever Starting March of I drank very heavily because of lockdown we made every night a drinking night sometimes at much as mixed drinks doubles maybe triples sometimes or if it was wine it was a bottle My heart rate was so insane at some points I thought I was having a cardiac event I remember driving myself to the ER and it was bpm while I was just sitting in my car at a stoplight Eventually I realized alcohol played a huge role in this I slowly started to cut back and even took as much as weeks off completely I started to deal with regular panic attacks depersonalization and weird head changes After adjusting my supplements getting some blood work done and optimizing I feel just fine most of the time probably My blood work shows no liver enzyme issues but I know those dont check for things like pancreas issues kidney etc Now here s the tricky part If I want to have a couple of drinks I feel normal while drinking just like I always did but the next days after are half way hell anxiety amp panic even if its just like beers the next day or are terrible The question is this some sort of reaction because I ve drank so heavily I ve damaged an organ and now this is my body s response I m wondering if someone has dealt with this type of issue Am I fine without alcohol but I m dealing with AWS alcohol withdraw symptom when I drink each time Sometimes I have slightly elevated heart rate but I have high blood pressure so is not abnormal necessarily But again if I dont drink for days I m not dealing with any anxiety any depersonalization or otherwise I can t imagine what else would cause me to have severe adverse reactions the day or after drinking Its mind boggling how I could drink days a week before several drinks and be fine but now having beers gives me anxiety the following days Anyone ,Depersonalization amp anxiety after drinking very little perfectly normal otherwise ,1

172,So this is really hard for me to post I ve been thinking about it back and forth for about months I don t know if I m an alcoholic but I m also starting to believe that my way of thinking is an excuse as I won t have to deal with it that way My story is as most people these days trauma etc I m not sure though if that s why I m drinking so much As a year old I could finish a bottle of wine during breakfast I used to laugh at myself thinking that I was cosplaying an alcoholic It was silly and I felt in total control It was a choice that I rarely made So rationally I never thought about it as alcoholism Life moved on I m close to today It started just before the pandemic I took a glas of red wine every evening I read an article that it was good for the heart and I thought that it d be nice to enjoy some wine on my own I told people at work that it was supposed to be good for the heart and several people asked me if I was an alcoholic I was pretty upset as I thought that one glas of wine every evening shouldn t be considered anywhere near alcoholism Anyway covid landed like a bomb in the world and things changed I started working from home day one It all started for me with zoom parties with friends We thought it d be good fun to get drunk on zoom play games and just enjoy each others company while getting drunk In truth I believe we all wanted an excuse to get drunk and it felt more okay while talking to each other pretending we had a party Thing is though I believe my friends stopped drinking after the call ended They probably put the bottle back on the shelf and went on with their lives Me on the other hand continued I drank until there was no more to consume I never considered this alcoholism just good fun But in time I drank more It started with a glas of wine while cooking dinner I looked forward to it all day After a while It got so hard to wait until dinner that I grabbed wine just before I had to start with dinner usually got so blackout drunk that I skipped dinner And a while after that I grabbed it while woking my last hour A while after that I grabbed a glas of wine during o clock break And then during lunch And then just before lunch And finally I grabbed a beer instead of milk as my drink of choice during breakfast So that s my backstory Yesterday I spent my savings on alcohol I couldn t take it being sober on a monday because mondays I promised a friend to meet up in a few days to watch a movie we talked about grabbing some wine before the movie I can t afford the wine in a bar so I ll probably get drunk just before I meet with her I don t know why I can t watch the movie sober I just feel that it s impossible My relationship with alcohol has gotten so very intense And I think it s showing even though no one dares to talk to me about it out loud I ve had friends mention alcoholism as something they ve come in contact with as a relative friend or a colleague to an alcoholic I can t help but think that they re trying to talk to me about it Why else mention it It s rarely been in context to whatever else we ve been talking about I ve had my family talk to me about relatives that been alcoholics which I never even knew until a few months ago so it obviously runs in the family though far back in history It s as if everyone sees it but me This has left me wondering and thinking a lot about it Are my habits the habits of an alcoholic Or am I just a normal person who lost my footing for a while during the pandemic Sorry for the long post I just feel lost at the moment and don t really know where to turn And don t feel like talking about it with my friends ,I think I might be an alcoholic,1
173,I have a question that I m hoping someone might be able to answer I ve looked around online and haven t found a satisfactory answer Anyway I d been drinking heavily for around years mostly binge drinking About months ago I ruined one relationship too many because of alcohol and decided to quit altogether It s been weeks so far The first months symptoms were relatively mild restless nights with the occasional brain fog during the day The weird thing is it seems to be getting worse over time nothing major but I still have trouble sleeping and the brain fog and headaches are almost everyday now Just wondering if this is a normal part of the process I guess it could be unrelated but I have no idea what , weeks sober,1
174,about a year ago when i was i made the decision to get sober it took some time for it to stick but i am now months sober i met my bestfriend in treatment and my life instantly changed she was the first real friendship i ever had because in the past i was always the one who cares more who loved more but with her everything was reciprocal i like to think of her as my friend soulmate and i truly believe that she was always meant to be in my life and then the worst thing possible happened she was swimming in the ocean and she just died the past weeks have been a major test of my sobriety my heart feels shattered i miss her more each day that goes by i still look over at her bed in our room every morning praying that this was all a sick nightmare it feels pointless to continue doing life and sobriety without the other half of my heart but i have to not only for her but for me i need to continue living this life for her idk where im going with this but i dont really have anyone to talk to because she was always my person i miss her so fucking much and everything seems lonely i wish this pain would just go away im not strong enough for this ,continuing feels impossible,1
175,Hi I m just now trying the steps for the first time as I got heavily addicted after couple years of sobriety Lost my fianc my home my job and am I m rehab right now As I m journaling and thinking about the steps especially making a list of my wrongs it just seems overwhelming Like I could write a whole notebook and it just makes me upset and full of guilt and shame about myself and makes me crave a lot when normally I don t for the most part It just makes me feel like a terrible person who hurt everyone I came around for my whole adult life For those of you that have made the list how did you deal with those feelings Did the making amends help in the end ,Making amends,1
176,I have four days I ve gone to a meeting everyday for those four days I ve confided in a friend my brother amp my partner that I m struggling and need help but I m struggling deeply with really believing the first step that I m powerless over alcohol Even though I know exactly what I did days ago that got me to this point And I know what happened two weeks before that and a week before that I thought I had drinking under control and honestly hidden suppressed and avoided all the wreckage that was headed my way pre pandemic The pandemic oddly provided a respite I replaced drinking heavily with weed and food and sometimes even just happy joyful moments with friends But lately the stressors have started to pick up the pace and so again has my drinking The time between huge fuck ups has decreased and the magnitude of the fuck ups has increased at such an astonishingly fast rate And yet I walked into the meeting today feeling like a fraud like I m just being dramatic and want attention and that s why I was in that meeting I couldn t say I was an alcoholic out loud I think that there is a chance I might not be an alcoholic because I don t drink every day I still have a great job and a car and a good credit score I feel like a fraud being in that room and then simultaneously feel like a fraud outside of the room because I can t admit out loud all the fucked up shit I ve done while drinking I just want to forget what I ve done and move on I know the people I ve told will probably give me a pass But those same people I ve hurt the most and will definitely lose if I keep fucking up like this I don t even know what the point of this post is Just needed to get this out because my brain feels like it s in a fog and moving too fast at once I just want relief ,Struggling with step ,1

189,I m struggling to make female friends in AA I m only about months in and everyone is very nice and accepting but I m having a hard time actually making friendships I ve always struggled with this since I was a kid I only have one BFF of all time and when she moved away I was alone until I found alcohol and partying Additionally I tend to only hang out with my boyfriend not good for me my relationship or my sobriety Now I m sober and it s good but I feel like a year old girl again No one to hang out with nothing to do no one to sit with I ve had a few coffee dates with women and they went ok but I m so crippled by social anxiety that I m generally a little quiet hard to get to know and honestly probably boring until you get over this VERY large hurdle of getting to know sober me I m dying inside because I have so much I want to say and I think I could be a great friend but am so awkward at first What do sober women DO together I think if we had something to do other than just talk a terrifying prospect it could help Any advice or support would be appreciated I m feeling a little raw and emotional and sad about my stunted social skills and loneliness As a kid I felt so alone it would be suffocating The feelings are coming back again,Making female friends in AA,1

196,Hey guys Thank you for your replies months ago Mom visited saw me taper and go thru hell at home detoxing Sober days Asked her to promise not to drink when she comes to visit She said yes Then I can tell she s drinking here She has extra anxiety provoking energy in day And bubbly at night I thought I could handle it and didn t say anything Well it was too much and I drank got psyical addicted and tapered and sober day or today Asked her to apologize for brining booze in house breaking her promise She won t Says I should take responsibility for my drinking Wrll yes I do it s my fault I took the first drink But knowing there was booze in the house and dealing with the up n downs of her energy added alot of pressure and I drank I own a biz have kids and wife and alot of stressor I don t think me taking responsibility for my drinking has anything to do whatsoever on her breaking her promise I believe whole heartedly it was a huge trigger for me Not an excuse me and my gal know we can t drink I would have never had mom visit If I knew she was drinking here Even if she was sneaking it and not coming out of her room I can feel it I have empathic qualities and I am so so sensitive to my environment and actively make it the best I can to help me stay sober I mean my gal and I did our first ever sober night vacay at the beach while mom watched our kids at home We didn t drink and had such a good time Neither of us knew if we could do the trip sober but moment by moment we did A promise is a promise I wouldn t do herion in my room if I was visiting a hermon addict if they asked me not to I would keep my promise or not visit if I knew it was a deal breaker for the person I was visiting Especially if I saw them shake and sweat and have crippling anxiety going thru withdrawals Well mom and her sister my aunt don t believe their is anything to apologize for Presumably because my drinking is on me But I am careful as heck about my life choices and situations to give me the best possible chances to stay sober She feels no remorse just points finger back at me I m not saying I drank because her and uts her fault I am saying I know my triggers and limits and made my boundaries clear before letting her visit I would love just some thoughts from anyone Maybe I am wrong about everything I could be of course Like if she just quit smoking and she said I can t visit her if I smoke on the trip and I agree Then I visit and smoke in my room anyway Just seems like ya I would be wrong to break my promise and feel some remorse and small responsibility for her relapse Because if I didn t do that she wouldn t of been around me smoking and smelling like smoke and sneaking off to smoke while we both know what I m doing without saying it Thanks for any feedback or thoughts or feeling from you guys in advance ,Ur opinion Mom visiting sneaking drinking in her room trigger,1

199, And FINALLY really working the steps Wasn t ready until I was ready and now I m ready Some of us get to be in the sometimes slowly category The important thing is that it works especially when you work it It s not like I ve been sitting around doing nothing while not drinking Been doing lots of other practices breathwork meditation yoga sauna cold water immersion intense daily journaling connecting with what I now consider my higher power and during Covid I had the luxury of being able to spend almost all of last year in the woods fishing camping exploring all the local places that are normally overrun with tourists Alaska Oh and being of service chairing hosting a weekly online Zoom meeting with my wife years in the program All of which set me up mentally emotionally spiritually to now do the work of the steps for real Which was good because when I caught Covid last month it hit me hard grateful for the vaccine suspect I d have died otherwise and I came out of it with the worst depression I ve had in years I wallowed until my much wiser wife suggested I go back to basics and work the first three steps Got myself a brand new old school sponsor and I ve been working the program harder than anything I ve worked at before Not just half stepping and playing lip service to it but committing to it completely Hey got news for you folks that are on the fence IT WORKS After writing about pages in step didn t know I had that much resentment I ve started step and looking forward to the rest of it Have had just a hint of a taste of the comprehension of the word serenity and I ve even had a few precious moments of genuine peace Thanks for reading this far and may you be blessed in all your endeavors , years today ,1
200, Game Day Photos https m imgur com a SsgHZJI So yeah I got sober years ago Life was pretty sucky Life was miserable I had a ready made family that loved me and supported me I had everything I ever wanted A loyal and great woman daughters and a son I had everything but the nice car house picket fence and dog But still drugs were all I gave a shit about I mean I cared and loved my family sure But I loved the feelings drugs produced more Then one day drugs stopped producing those feelings that I loved And suddenly I could no longer deal with the world and the chaos I created I knew how to be clean but didn t know how to be sober Didn t know how to live life on life s terms My fix was no longer fixing a goddamn thing in fact my fix was making things exponentially worse It s a tricky spot to be in when you re sick of living but too scared to die Suicide was contemplated attempted and failed That day I failed for the last time and gave in to the notion that I had a problem needed help wanted help and would succeed or die trying to get better years later I m recovered I have my off days sure anxiety depression commitment problems disdain for authority still love starting chaos saying things when I should bite my tongue saying things incorrectly without regards to others feelings posting shitty memes and starting facebook dumpster fires I m not perfect But now a days I don t really enjoy being the center of attention I actually get anxious over it no one who remembers the old me would ever believe that Nowadays I do have the nice car the house the picket fence cats and a dog It s wild to me Today was a huge day for me and my son But in typical selfish me form I m concentrating on why it was so huge to me Since little Pete was born I always wanted to take him to a NFL football game And do all that cool shit you see other Dads doing with their kids on TV and in Movies ALWAYS But it always seemed like a pipe dream to me during my days of active addiction Then I got clean and in my mind I made mental notes a check list of sorts of things I wanted to accomplish or at least try to accomplish I ve checked off a TON And today was another one of them Today was super special to me and I hope to my son too We were gifted an opportunity from a random stranger to make this memory And after the game on our drive home there was a homeless guy asking for money me and Pete gave him a few bucks I asked Pete if he knew why He said You do good things so you get good things in return And I smiled and said Yes and no dude We re supposed to pay it forward and do good things without expectation of anything in return We had a blast today because someone did something nice for us and didn t want anything in return so we pay it forward like Lindsey Kozecke would always tell us to do Pete looked at me and said Ahhh I got ya but he did want you to do something in return he wanted you to take that video with him and send him pictures I smiled and was like Damn touch the kid is wise beyond his years because even though we say we do good things for others without any expectation of anything in return and try to practice altruism ultimately it is for some self serving purpose no matter how minute it may be For me my self serving purpose is to continue to be blessed enough to make these kind of memories with my family Best part about being sober is there is no set check list it s all tentative we just keep adding to the list day by day Thanks Lindsey miss ya This isn t to diminish the things I ve done with each of my daughters We have our memories too Individual and as a family unit I hope when they see this they don t think I don t love them or not proud of them Trust me ladies we ve checked off many on my list too Proud of all my kids ,First Game ,1

202,My dad has always enjoyed a cocktail in the evenings But he has ALWAYS been able to hold his liquor I was never aware of any issues growing up My parents divorced when I was and my dad lives on my grandparents property in a studio style cottage My grandpa dads side is addicted to any pain relief he can get his hands on Primarily pills and pain patches but alcohol will do if he can t get his hands on his meds He has been like that his entire life His brother my dads uncle struggled with addiction as well I ve never seen my dad take so much as an Advil So I thought he escaped the genetic predisposition Both my grandparents have health problems My grandma more so is declining RAPIDLY and my dad is their primary caretaker since he lives there It s depressing to watch and exhausting to deal with She s on oxygen right now and it s really an ordeal to take her anywhere because she s weak and can barely walk on her own let alone carry her oxygen Shes still working full time because my grandpa spent every penny they ever made So they can t afford to go into assisted living or have an aide come to the house Nor do they want an aide I have begun noticing my dad is drinking a lot more He was never visibly drunk when I was a kid but now when I see him and he is drinking he slurs some words or speaks a lot slower because he s making sure he doesn t slur He uses excessive hand movements when storytelling It s just all too obvious that he s wasted I ve also noticed he has shaky hands even when I know he s not drinking I used to wonder if it was Parkinson s But now I think it s from not drinking My father who is a very strong willed man has opened up on a few occasions about the immense pressure he s under taking care of my grandparents He s working full time but coming home to make sure they re cared for His only peace of the day is when he s asleep Work is his escape from his responsibilities But work is it s own pressure As far as I m aware he does not drink and go to work But he drinks at night when he comes home I m worried and I don t know what to do about it It s unlikely to stop while my grandparents are alive I don t even know what to say I either tell him I m worried and put MORE on his plate or I say nothing and watch him drink Or I tell him I m worried and expect him to stop drinking and just live with the pressure closing in on him Any input appreciated,I think my dad is abusing alcohol and I don t know what to do,1
203,I tried a handful of meetings right before COVID even took a newcomers chip and eventually a day chip Would hang around before and after and no one came up and spoke to me about sobriety Alcohol provided an outgoing personality that I don t naturally have and when sober I am beyond timid and quiet I am scared and disappointed to even go back I ve made contact with a sober friend and they promised a meeting with their sponsor and it seems everyone falls thru and I have literally no one to talk to except my bourbon That s why I just started this account I want someone to talk to I want to be sober I m not an eloquent writer not into details just lonely and wondering if anyone else is too ,Stuck,1
204,I ve been fortunate in that the obsession was lifted from me early on in sobriety This month will be years I still have work to do and I still have a long list of amends I m in the process of making I got into a relationship recently and it s illuminated a lot of defects I ve been able to avoid by remaining single It s become even clearer to me how important completing my amends is and how important it is to let go of my own will and have patience I don t think I d want to date somebody who s also a sober alcoholic I like the fact that I m dating a fun girl and I ve never felt any degree of insecurity over being sober in a social situation But this relationship has really challenged me I am finding myself having a tougher time than ever feeling comfortable in sobriety and I even picked up smoking again and quit again and will smoke the off cigarette and have to go through the quitting process I don t think my girlfriend is an alcoholic but it s really hard to say because I have such a distorted view of alcohol and the last thing I want to do is take somebody else s inventory She seemingly can stop once she starts but drinks more nights than not and was easily the drunkest person at a gathering she had tonight It shouldn t bother me but it does All things equal I care about and enjoy her How do I find the answer How do I know what is too much for me Does anyone have experience they can offer being in a similar place ,How do I know if my girlfriend drinks too much ,1

207,Hi Folks Disclaimer I made this account just to post here but I ve been a Redditor for almost a decade I am newly sober yay I recognized I had a problem told my wife and got help Went through a medical detox I recommend this for hard core drinkers ready to quit and now I m in an Intense Outpatient Program IOP I realize that when my treatment program is complete I ll need continued support I have a therapist lined up and I ve been to an AA meeting I am was planning on AA as a big part of recovery plan Here s my issue and as a newbie I hope you guys can give me some direction guidance I am a hardcore atheist I ve been an atheist activist for many years I ve had some conversations about this with my therapist but not to the extent I d like I ve read chapter of the big book regarding this and it didn t give me a truly satisfying answer besides being a painful read Some other points to give further context I am going into this with an open heart and open mind There are definitely elements in AA that I think are very valuable and I believe can help me maintain my sobriety The AA meeting I attended was very welcoming but very religious In their defense a big part of that was that the topic was the prayer from According to Bill regarding step And some hurdles I ve been studying philosophy for more than three decades I know that we can t generally just choose our beliefs We re either convinced or were not I m not sure what spiritually is I ve never heard a coherent definition of spiritual I ve talked to folks who say that we can choose anything to be our higher power someone even suggested a doorknob If we re just using things like that not actual god s aren t we then really relying on ourselves Something antithetical to the central tenet of AA I was also told that this higher power had to be all powerful and has to have the ability to enact the change that I m not capable of Is this true It seems to contradict some of the point in the previous bullet Thank you in advance for any guidance you can give me My responses might seem argumentative or that I m the very picture of Bill s mischaracterization of what atheism is but I m just being as honest as I can If AA is not an option for me I d like to know sooner rather than later ,Some help from the group please,1

209,I have almost month sober and I ve shared like times in some meetings back home and have felt like it was fine In one of those meetings I remember the speaker even said newcomers should feel free to share But I went to a new meeting today and the chairperson went on a whole story about how people shouldn t share after they get one year sober It was directed at me because only one other person was there with years There were only THREE people at the meeting including myself and the chairperson so I didn t think it would a big deal I rarely share anyway but this turned me off I was just wondering what some other groups rules were or if this was a general rule Thanks ,What are the rules for people sharing in early sobriety ,1

216,Hey everyone A little over a month ago I had posted about how I had engaged in gossip character assassination and how I had had to endure the consequences of that Some people in the fellowship had turned against me I basically ended up leaving AA as a whole I quit all my service positions and left my sponsor A few days after leaving my hands started to get all sweaty and my thoughts started racing the way I used to before I was in the program I actually got trembling hands It actually felt as if I was going through alcohol withdrawal I basically had options relapse or be a dry drunk or go back to AA I live in the relatively small town with a rather small AA fellowship so it s pretty impossible to go to completely different meetings and never run into those people again I contacted my old sponsor and she s my sponsor again I ve also resumed my service positions I haven t apart from to my sponsor though I haven t really made amends yet because the people I had issues with have somehow disappeared For two of them it doesn t really surprise me they were primarily in NA and I m in AA But one came to lots of AA meetings too and I haven t seen her since I m sure she ll be back though It s strange though I wonder where those people have gone ,Treachery and treason update,1
217,Alright so I had a problem with drinking in the first half of the year and a medical problem that seemed at first life threatening forced me to quit with my family s support Recently I ve had to move to a different city alone and after a particularly stressful day decided it would be good to celebrate my health progress with a few glasses of wine I was irritable felt my head hurt thought I d be relaxed enough to sleep but just got more uncomfortable everything about my body felt wrong The first half glass felt okay I could imagine it helping me get more social if I was with friends but after that WHY DID I LIKE THIS SHIT ITS HORRIBLE MY HEAD HURT I WAS TOSSING AND TURNING TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP I thought this would help me relax and it didn t I guess this is good it seems I ve finally managed to get more normal in my affinity for Alcohol Just wanted to share ,why the fuck did I ever like this crap ,1

231,Whether you re confident or insecure a genius or intellectually challenged tall or short fat or thin bald or bestowed with a luscious mane manic or depressed anxious or laid back or anything in between God designed us to be exactly who we are Our self perceived assets and shortcomings may be hard to grapple with But what God bestowed us with are God s gifts to us What we do with these qualities are our gifts back to God The sooner we can accept and take accountability for the roles we have been given the more readily we can embrace our journeys I may not like being a sensitive person but God likes it because it makes me compassionate I may not see the value in my health problems but God didn t create me this way for no reason If I think about my challenges hard enough I can see how they might be worked into qualities that benefit the world and make me a better person The next time you find yourself cursing your bad hair your stutter or those extra ten pounds remember that they re not meaningless Just like your ability to comfort a grieving friend ace that biology exam or bake the best cookies in town aren t either We struggle to see ourselves through God s lens rather than the world s but which of these perspectives actually matters I believe that when we die these confusing conditions will make more sense But what if we could learn to accept the roles that we ve been given before that How would that change the quality of our lives and the lives of those around us Today I encourage all of us to examine the possible meanings behind our many qualities How can we use them to make the world a kinder gentler more beautiful place God thinks you re perfect exactly as we are Who are we to question the roles God has assigned to us ,Whatever roles we are playing God designed them specifically for us ,1

234,I m so confused and I m not sure if I m actually an alcoholic or what my problem is I got arrested for th OWI in February and started going to AA meetings but in the back of my mind there was always this little doubt telling me I want really an alcoholic and I m being over dramatic and just want attention or something I do relate in meetings and people seem to relate with me when I share but this little seed of doubt has not gone away I ended up relapsing in August after months and struggled to stay sober for a full day all through September September th I got drunk for the last time and started going to meetings again on the th I typically drink days a week and I black out about half the time maybe more I m not sure At this point I mostly drink on my own at home because I m afraid of blacking out in public but that doesn t stop the shame and embarrassment I feel the next morning Not to mention the drunk texts phone calls that I don t remember The other day on this sub I made a comment about how when I try to control my drinking I can t enjoy it and when I try to enjoy it I can t control it And another user here started telling me that I wasn t an alcoholic and they weren t sure why I wanted to be an alcoholic so badly and that my disabilities don t make me an alcoholic and that alcoholics recognize each other and they don t see it with me Other than depression and anxiety I don t have any known disabilities and I m just very confused now mostly because they said things that I ve always kind of thought were true that I m not actually an alcoholic and I don t really belong in AA I was feeling pretty good about my Sobriety until that altercation now all I can think about is getting drunk to prove them wrong even though they re a stranger on the internet who is now blocked and will never know or care whether they were right or wrong Basically I m just tired of arguing with myself about everything I thought I was doing the right thing now I feel like I m just wasting people s time going to meetings and that I really don t belong there I don t want to fight with the world I don t want to be an alcoholic if I can drink safely I would like to I just don t know what to think anymore ,Am I in the wrong place ,1
235,I think I finally see what I have to do It really sucks that I can t get my way but it will be okay If God is everything then I ll never be alone I refuse to give up my sobriety Am I an asshole for giving my boyfriend an ultimatum God I hope not I just cannot be a part of a relationship where drinking is ok I want to be sober I want to live a useful life I want to be joyous happy and free I know I can t talk to him while he s drinking but as soon as I get the opportunity I know the words will come either you join AA or I can t be with you anymore I don t know what that will mean will he move out Will I But it doesn t matter I will no longer allow anything to come between me and my program This is it I m standing at a turning point and I know that with God s help and every friend I ve made in the rooms everything will be alright Thanks for letting me share P S I deleted my post last night because I got paranoid that he would find it and get crazy he has a history of abusive behavior while drinking ,Still sober Boyfriend woke up at am to keep drinking ,1
236,I ve never been addicted to alcohol to the point where I need it every day or have gotten the shakes or any other withdrawal symptoms It used to be a chance though that I would binge until blackout and make an absolute fool of myself A part of me thinks this is the addiction creeping in but the more optimistic side of me thinks I could seriously use it to benefit my life by improving my ability to socialize with friends I feel like marijuana and porn have always disrupted my life the most Those are constant addictions that never leave Let s just say I was to quit those and heal some trauma from my past to become a person that I am proud of Would it then be okay to try drinking again ,If I heal the pain and trauma inside of me will I be able to drink again one day as a social lubricant ,1
237,I ve been in and out of AA for years now since I was ordered as a teen But I ve only been working the program in earnest for about years now I have a sponsor I work the steps I do service I go to meetings I pray and meditate and try to live in the principles I m far from perfect in all these things but I try I work for my recovery like it s life or death because it is My sobriety is amazing But I can t seem to make it more than months before relapsing in my experience this far I look and listen to those around me and they all seem to have this wonderful comradery that I ve never experienced in AA Sure I have people I m friendly with or would even consider friends but I don t feel as connected as others or as is described in the book I can t help but wonder if this disconnect is one of my missing pieces I feel like I just don t have it in me It s exhausting and there aren t enough hours in the day to dedicate to trying to forge bonds with other alcoholics For context I have my immediate family whom are at the tippy top of my people I m close to group and very few close friends partially because of my drinking and partially because I ve only ever had a limited amount of emotional availability to give others So I hear how great and important the bond is to others and wonder if I m screwed if I can t achieve that TIA for your experience strength and hope ,Never experienced the joy of fellowship Am I doomed What if I never get it How can I get it ,1
238,There s one in every meeting Open discussions are the worst The chairperson asks for a topic two seconds pass and the gratitude guy jumps in with a shit eating smile saying you know what I m going to bring up then follows with a gratitude topic He ll do it two or three days a week if you let him There s something sadistic about the way he introduces it as if it were punishment for someone not jumping into the fray with another topic Another form of forced family fun Don t get me wrong I think gratitude is a good thing Sometimes I need to hear about it from others but not from the gratitude guy Somebody please put a muzzle on him In the meantime I m going to focus on attending newcomer and literature step study meetings Thank you for letting me share ,Fuck the gratitude guy ,1

242, I think I finally get what the book means by self seeking Well this isn t a philosophical debate about split words and picking apart the nuance of the book I must admit I do enjoy that sort of thing It s just not what I m going to be talking about here You re welcome Instead this is a sort of fifth step I say sort of for two reasons Primarily because it s not a first fifth step I m one of those guys that upon finishing the steps loops back to the start and goes through it again I do believe and practice my daily maintenance steps but I also find it rewarding to slowly go back and focus on each step one at a time Unfortunately I don t have a sponsor right now and I just moved so I let myself off the hook and decided not to share the fifth step After all the book says this step can be postponed So I justified my fear with that excuse Some may say what I m sharing here isn t a fifth step at all To them I say yup you re right I m probably confused Instead what this could be is a portion of our maintenance steps It s around steps and where the book suggests we ask ourselves if we have kept anything to ourselves which should be shared with another alcoholic The second reason I say this is only sort of a fifth step is that a fifth step is when I share on the defects revealed by the fourth step This is only about one defect because it flows from one resentment Tonight I said the seventh step prayer as I thought I was on this step Trust me I m sick and tired of this defect It s unbearably painful and has caused repeated difficulty in my life However as I said the prayer I was hit with an overwhelming feeling of guilt I know I haven t told anyone about this defect I argued with myself at first stating I talk about it all the time Probably too much People are tired of hearing about it at this point Here s the thing No matter how badly I would like it to count complaining about the other person is not the same as revealing my defect So here it is My great big defect is self seeking Yup I like sticking to the four categories the book lists but don t worry I m not letting myself off that easily I will elaborate and give specifics This term has produced great confusion for me It sounds so much like selfishness it s hard for me to conceptualize what it is I think I get it now and I think it s my problem It started to make sense when I heard someone say they were seeking self in others And that my friends is a definition I can work with The instant I heard them say that I related It s absolutely something I do and have done Its resulted in so much headache and pain in my life When I was I had enough of my Dad For the purpose of brevity I ll keep the jist of that relationship to one sentence he hurt me badly repeatedly At I said no and refused to return to his house It was for my emotional well being and I do not regret the decision It was the right call according to logic and reason Emotions as we all know don t often accept reason and logic Looking back on it I can see that rejecting my Father left me deeply wounded I wanted so much from him I wanted his love approval and respect I wanted my Dad to be proud of me and he simply wasn t If I take the book s suggestion to view the other person as sick well maybe he just wasn t capable of those things Or more charitably he wasn t capable of displaying those things in a healthy and normal manner Regardless I belive my father was an early example act of self seeking Don t get me wrong I was perfectly normal for feeling those feelings The self seeking aspect is that I was seeking my self worth in him I m not anything like a psychologist but I wouldn t be surprised if this is a normal thing for a boy to do How then can such a normal thing be a defect Well one answer comes from the and our natural healthy instincts can get out of whack over the course of life Additionally I don t believe a defect is all that bad of a thing That is to say I don t view defects as sin They certainly can be and frequently present themselves as such but it s my understanding that they are simply defects in my character If I were a line of code it would be an error and my divine developer would like my permission to correct it so that I may function in line with my true nature At this point in my program no pun intended it doesn t hurt my feelings AS MUCH AS IT USED TO to discover a new defect After the age of father idolization came to an end I got myself a high school sweetheart She was my world I ignored my friends family and school work to be with her I thought I was in love with her I wasn t Real love is something akin to admiring a moth that lands on your porch You don t grab it and make it yours forever I did metaphorically grab that girl and try and make her mine forever Self seeking That searching for myself my value in her was not love but a defect A defect that made the end of the relationship unbearable It was at that time I began seeking comfort in a bottle The self seeking didn t evaporate with the liquor Instead it carried on with numerous people My drug dealer my next girlfriend and the girl after that to name a few You might be wondering at this point if I m confused and actually uncovered codependency Well maybe I don t think so but I see where you re coming from because I m wondering the same thing I don t know that much about codependency so my analysis is rudimentary at best That being said I think codependency is when you re dependent on another person Perhaps self seeking as I interpret it can rise to a level of dependence Yet at its core I think self seeking is something you do to yourself These instances I m sharing about involve other people but I don t think that is a necessity of the defect When I m honest as I can be with myself I see that this defect also occurred with positions of status For example I was raised Christian and went to a Christian school I looked for value in my Christianity and I don t mean I found my self worth in my faith I was not about that I looked for value in the status of being holier than my Christian peers It was about the status of it I later did the same thing with my position in Boy Scouts I will be the best Senior Patrol Leader not to help you but to seek myself in that position of status Then later as a stoner I let you know how I skipped work and class on April th so I could validate my identity When I got into shrooms I bragged about ego death the irony was lost on me to validate my self perception This brings us to the most recent time this defect burnt me I lost a close friend I want to tell you all the little petty things he did to me and gripe and moan about him but honestly it doesn t matter In reality he didn t do anything too bad to me He did some stuff and I did some stuff We ve had arguments We ve been dicks to each other from time to time It happens when you re that close to a person He changed over the years and so did I We got on each other s nerves more and more frequently because of those changes I ended up getting a different job and moving Now we don t talk In the good old days we had an inside joke about a certain number It became his number It seems that every time I look at a page number the time my phone s battery or a license plate I see the number and I m filled with anger Every petty thing he ever did wrong comes rushing back to my mind It s been months and I m sick and tired of this resentment The reason it hurts so damn bad is because I was absolutely seeking myself in him I remained his close friend for so long not because I valued his company but because I had to After all who is Burton Guster without Shawn Spencer Who is Robin without Batman Nightwing Shaggy is just a stoner without scooby doo It wasn t fair of me to put that burden of self validation on anyone else s shoulders It s essentially a lie a distortion of the truth Rather than seeing who those people were I saw who I wanted them to be I can t really get to know them if I m seeing a mirage of who they are Maybe I knew them well at one point in time but I can t watch them grow as a person when I m by nature of self seeking only seeing the aspects of them that validate me This self seeking via another person limits my ability to be a good friend because I m approaching the relationship selfishly This aspect of the defect doesn t really apply to institutions and status but the next portion applies to everything Self seeking harms me It keeps me from seeing the position or person as they really are It s the opposite of acceptance and a total lack of self respect When I look for my value in external places it s selling myself short It s robbing me of truly knowing myself I said earlier that I m sick and tired of this defect I am but at the same time I see why the book tells me to pause and review the other steps before moving on I need them in order to take step six In order to truly be willing to have this defect removed I must be willing to truly experience reality I must be willing to learn who I am That terrifies this alcoholic It s only through using those first three steps can I possibly take the next two Thank you for letting me share this ,I think I finally get what the book means by self seeking,1

251,So I m not sure if this is the right place to post this but basically today was my th day sober in almost years of drinking every day this is the longest I ve gone and I didn t plan on it honestly I ve just been pushing myself day after day but today it became too much with smoking more than I usually do randomly crying shaking constantly I felt I can drink if I want to I m a grown adult I m not hurting anyone so yes I want to drink All I bought was a L boxed cooler as I know my boyfriend probably wouldn t want to see me drunk but he just keeps lecturing me about how I said I don t want to drink anymore and about how easy it would ve been to just not drink and talking about all the times I was drunk before this past week I ve never done anything embarrassing or harmful to anyone when I drink I m pretty chill he just hates that I drink because he doesn t and the way he s talking to me is really starting to hurt me I don t expect someone that isn t an alcoholic to understand my mind but I expect them to at least try and understand my situation I m not sure how to deal with this so if someone went through something similar I d appreciate some input,Boyfriend doesn t understand,1
252,Then it leads to a binge lol,how do you avoid the voice in your head that convinces you to drink again for that one day,1
253,I feel like an idiot saying this I earned my seat in AA a long time ago and quit for years and then starting smoking and I cannot stop out of habit and a fondness of the program I m back but I feel like my problem is different this time but is it okay to be there There are lack of other types of meetings in my area What do you think ,Am I a poser if I m trying to quit weed ,1
254, days ago I went to bed drunk for the last time I spent years drinking myself stupid and I believe I found my rock bottom weeks ago I ve spent the last days one day at a time picking up the pieces I m scared that it s been a bit too easy I spent the first days of sobriety in a hospital for detox before just leaving to get off the Ativan paradoxical reaction had me feeling worse than drinking or being hung over I was a heavy whiskey drinker IMO pints a day plus seltzers for chasers While functioning I was merely in auto pilot I feared the physical withdrawal the worst and think that s what kept me from being sober so long I keep waiting for this overwhelming urge to drink and it hasn t crept up yet or I ve fought it well I cant tell I think of drinking often only to find it more habit than desire I quickly remember the raging asshole that comes out when emotion surface while I m shitfaced or I hold on to the moments I ve been blessed to be present in in the last days and suddenly the right choice becomes easy to make Has anyone else s sobriety seem almost too easy Am I in for a jolt A surprise I ve been hearing the first days are the hardest I fear letting my guard down Is it possible to just decide I ve given enough time and years and money and energy to drinking and just be done with it Am I fooling myself , days and counting ,1
255,Hi Ive been sober for days now and attending meetings Today I finally realized that one of my triggers for drinking is the stress my wife has In my eyes she is stressing about silly menial things She shares it with me and just makes me want to drink How can I tell her nicely that her stressing is a trigger for me for wanting to get drunk ,Wife is a trigger to drink how to tell her ,1
256,So my partner and I both go to meetings He s very very shy but he always tells me after what he would have said if he dared He s struggling with what do you do when you ve made being an alcoholic your kind of joke y social identity but now suddenly it s serious How do you handle when that was your whole gig Your kind of social trade mark ,Bf too shy to speak at meetings Anyone here wanna support him instead ,1
257,I made some mistakes in early sobriety because I was such a chaotic mess when I came into the rooms I still kind of him to be honest but I m truly trying to follow suggestions and stay much tighter with my sponsor Long story short I ended up having an inappropriate relationship with two different men in the program who both had significantly more time than me and years respectively Three months in I can see it as being a mistake and I feel like managing the emotions I have from these interactions has nearly costs me my sobriety dozens of times At first it was a big source of shame for me and I kept it a secret from my female friends in the program but eventually after just going through so much emotional turmoil I started to open up to people including my sponsor about what was going on I ve gotten mixed feedback Often I hear I ve been a victim even though I initiated both interactions and other times I hear that I should ve been more focused on my sobriety and taking the suggestion not get involved in a relationship I m just at the point now where I feel so much anger and confusion I am soooo uncomfortable around any man at the meetings now because I feel like now I m constantly questioning their intentions even though most of the people I ve encountered are really good people who want me to do well The men I was always with chair meeting and are on the board for our club They sponsor other men and people really look to them as examples and I just feel so disgusted at them for being hypocritical I have the impulse to just want to put them publicly in meetings just out of spite I know anger and resentment are awful for alcoholics but I m not on the steps yet that will allow me to process that I just feel like these men knew where I was in in my program and they took actions knowing I wouldn t even have the tools to properly cope with a falling out I want to bring stepping up in a meeting and I know my intentions aren t right for wanting to do that but I just feel like I want justice and for everyone to know about these guys stepping is a really painful thing for the newcomer to process I can speak for myself because I m going through it now ,Should I bring up stepping in a newcomer meeting ,1

264, When we became alcoholics crushed by a self imposed crises we could not postpone or evade we had to fearlessly face the proposition that either God is everything or else He is nothing God either is or He isn t What was our choice to be Actually we were fooling ourselves for deep down in every man woman and child is the fundamental idea of God It may be obscured by calamity by pomp by worship of other things but in some form or other it is there For faith in a Power greater than ourselves and miraculous demonstrations of that power in human lives are facts as old as man himself Both of mine are from Chapter We Agnostics It s honestly my favorite chapter of the Big Book however it didn t always make sense to me The first time I read it I didn t actually comprehend what it was saying And once I had read the chapter once I didn t have to read it again right So I stayed around for a couple weeks and I had my first spiritual experience I didn t know that s what it was at the time but looking back it definitely was I was leaving my usual meeting and as I got into my car an overwhelming wave of everything is going to be ok washed over me I felt completely accepted like my AA hall was where I belonged my entire life I was alone in my car and the emotions I was feeling were equivalent to my parents giving me a hug and telling me they loved me Later going through the steps with a sponsor we get to chapter I read it and get to those two quotes And everything clicks I finally know that I don t have to definitively know who or what my higher power is I just have to know that it is I d felt that feeling I got in my car before maybe not to that magnitude but I d felt it So that s the fundamental idea of God inside of me ,What readings helped you get over your spiritual hesitation ,1

266,MY CHECKLIST NOT YOURS Gossip barbed with our anger a polite form of murder by character assassination has its satisfactions for us too Here we are not trying to help those we criticize we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p Sometimes I don t realize that I gossiped about someone until the end of the day when I take an inventory of the day s activities and then my gossiping appears like a blemish in my beautiful day How could I have said something like that Gossip shows its ugly head during a coffee break or lunch with business associates or I may gossip during the evening when I m tired from the day s activities and feel justified in bolstering my ego at the expense of someone else Character defects like gossip sneak into my life when I am not making a constant effort to work the Twelve Steps of recovery I need to remind myself that my uniqueness is the blessing of my being and that applies equally to everyone who crosses my path in life s journey Today the only inventory I need to take is my own I ll leave judgment of others to the Final Judge Divine Providence Browse AA Online Resources https aa intergroup org oiaa resources My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist Find Next Available Meeting https aa intergroup org oiaa meetings ,Daily Reflections Oct ,1
267,I thought about making a throwaway account but screw it I ve been able to be sober for about months twice since I started drinking because I was pregnant with my two beautiful girls PPD with my oldest didn t help me at all and I m not using it as an excuse Nobody would listen to me The antidepressants my doctor put me on made it worse So I said to hell with it and drank My oldest was about a month month and a half old When I drank I wasn t angry at everyone minus my daughter my PPD never targeted her myself or the world It felt like everything just lifted off my shoulders and I finally felt somewhat normal That should of been a massive red flag but I was so deep in my depression a whole carnival of red flags could of been right in my face and I wouldn t of even noticed it I drank quite a bit before my oldest but after PPD it got so much worse Due to the PPD it took years before I was finally ready to try for another child I got pregnant pretty instantly I m talking within a month Unfortunately we lost that one within a month Two months later we were gifted our rainbow Again sober whole pregnancy She was a month old when I took that drink I thought Well I ll have DH handle the kids and have a chill night and relax I look back now and laugh not with humor but with disgust It s never just one night is it She ll be five in five months I know I need to stop Went two days without drinking this week which is a big deal for me Then last night my bright self decided to just finish what was left of my little under half th of Jim Beam It takes a lot to get me drunk anymore and I wasn t drunk Decent buzz but something happened when I laid down to go to bed My heart was racing my brain was going every which direction and I almost started crying because I realized I don t like that feeling anymore I felt out of control I felt out of control with my body my emotions This is the first time where I ve said to myself Im done Im not even sad Im not anxious about it and I have horrible anxiety Im never calm I live in a small town and really don t want to attend AA meetings here but I can t drive minutes to the nearest town either I don t care about seeing Billy or Martha at the grocery store Im just a private person and I m embarrassed and ashamed I just wanted to know if there s anyway to get a sponsor online and do online AA meetings where I don t have to show my face I m talker and I need someone who understands and I can talk to on the bad days because I know they re coming Sorry for the long post ,Trying this again ,1

327,Cross posed this is another community a few days ago but want to get some more perspectives from maybe some different people I recently found out a friend has been going to a bar times a week I know that alone this may or may not seem to be significant but how they are going about this is what is concerning and making me think that they ve developed a problem Or at least are heavily relying on alcohol as a crutch for their problems To start they lie about what they are doing They say they are going out with other friends or spending time with their family but the only thing they have planned is to end up drinking at their bar of choice Note they found out we knew this was going on so they started going to a different bar When they do this they are alone They meet no one but occasionally bring someone they ve met home for a hookup They literally sit at the bar order drink after drink scroll their phone and then drive home They often leave their house late in the evening PM and don t return home from the bar until after AM most nights unfortunately driving themselves home And they have to be at work by AM most days They hide what they are doing very well Or at least they try They are a well established adult in their s who is intelligent has a good but high stress job and are a very calm person so most people would not know they have a problem I know that alcoholism does not discriminate though Being honest I have experience dealing with alcoholism I m guessing most people will not say that any of this is normal Does anyone have a similar experience they can share and how they handled it I m not sure what to say or even do I want to be a helpful friend but not cross any lines I guess my question is how can I let them know they have a problem encourage them to get help and that I m intervening because I care ,When Does Going To A Bar Alone Become A Sign Of A Bigger Problem ,1

339,On Saturday at my home group an old timer with years who I very much admire brought up an issue He vocalized that he thought our group should rethink closing the meeting with the Lords Prayer He said that it s a Christian prayer and has the potential to alienate new comers who might not share that particular faith I as a non Christian agree with him although I did not vocalize it at the time I never recite the Lords Prayer even though my home group closes with it every week It s a Catholic prayer and I personally find the Catholic Church to be a corrupt and questionable institution I wouldn t never try and steer someone away from their faith as I believe it is a deeply personal choice But I agree that AA prayers should be non denominational The old timer who brought this up was very polite and provided examples of alternatives that are in the big book The next day I attended another meeting and over heard a group of men saying some pretty vicious things about this guy for merely making a suggestion A suggestion I quite frankly agree with completely The guys talking shit are also old timers with lots of sober time under their belts Guys who I previously looked up too in a lot of ways I m torn between feeling like this shouldn t be such a big deal to me and wanting to speak up about it I have and always will refuse to recite a Catholic or Christian prayer I m fairly certain if I tried to close a meeting with an Islamic or Hindu verse there would be fits thrown I know this should probably be something I just shrug off but I ve done a lot of metal gymnastics already as an atheist in AA I m a younger guy with just shy of two years clean in a home group full of old timey book thumpers with decades of sobriety Try as I may I can t shake this from my mind Can I get some perspective or advice please ,Need some perspective from fellow AA s ,1

355,I got my reddit cake day reminder last night years ago I drunkenly created this user name and reached out here for help I was told to go to meetings get a sponsor work the steps help others get involved among other things Since coming back to AA God has done marvelous things in my life If you don t believe in God we can call it Me getting out of the way My life is full I am a loving man I am useful If your life is dark and you feel hopeless I plead that you really give AA a shot Not just an AA sub on reddit or checking out some zoom meetings get involved Get a sponsor set out chairs help clean up give people rides to the meeting call people chair meetings get a home group get plugged in amp x B I alone am not responsible for these changes my own experience proved that time and time again This part of the book is one of the first things I read with my sponsor He told me I had to stop with the belligerence fighting to stay sick yeah buts and demonstrate some willingness I was taught that willingness is action I wanted A LOT of things in my life but what actions did I actually take to get them amp x B My actual sobriety date is Oct I went to a friends wedding on Oct knowing full well I was going to drink But I also knew the end was near I was circling the drain I was beaten down It was the most miserable night of drinking I drank not because I wanted to but because I HAD to There was no choice I drank full well knowing that I was done it was a very strange feeling The next day I went to a meeting and that s when things began to change Oh how dark it is before the dawn indeed From The Spiritual Experience Most of us think this awareness of a Power greater than ourselves is the essence of spiritual experience Our more religious members call it God consciousness Most emphatically we wish to say that any alcoholic capable of honestly facing his problems in the light of our experience can recover provided he does not close his mind to all spiritual principles He can only be defeated by an attitude of intolerance or belligerent denial We find that no one need have difficulty with the spirituality of the program WILLINGNESS HONESTY AND OPEN MINDEDNESS ARE THE ESSENTIALS OF RECOVERY BUT THESE ARE INDISPENSABLE There is a principle which is a bar against all information which is proof against all arguments and which cannot fail to keep a man in everlasting ignorance that principle is contempt prior to investigation HERBERT SPENCER ,Reddit Cake Day,1
356,I have been drinking heavily lately I m a male looking for advice to stop this cancer like habit I m realizing more and more that I can t really give up this habit without help My parents have went on a trip and not having them here has lead me to feel more less restricted on the drinking I ask what advice if there is any that I don t already know To stop this habit ,Introduction,1
357,Title pretty much says it all I abused psychedelics as a late teen early s person It got bad I definitely have an addictive element to me But I also have general life long depression and anxiety and probably some kind of OCD i do have issues Was I happier when I was in early sobriety living a carefree life in a halfway house surrounded by insane people constantly socializing While still half way high from drug use Sure That was a like I m an adult now All my friends have gotten married I m pretty darn isolated was very hard on me as I got laid off early pandemic from a real career and didn t get a real job for about months I relocated back to my parents and sister s family area I have no friends here I thought would be a big comeback year Turns out my new job of pretty toxic I got mono and was really sick from July rd through just recently I m still freaked out by covid especially after being sick for months and my closest coworker is a covid long hauler and suffering every day And returning home as I push years old single isolated I ve been taking to and seeing my parents a lot Our relationship has degraded at times to points that are very similar to my rough teenage years Which I totally did not expect They clearly have PTSD from what I put them through Just being around me so much more and also seeing my increasingly unhappy sick for months can t eat hardly anything unhappy with work feel lost they are super triggered They seem to think I m going to go full alcoholic rapidly or just kill myself or something This is very much them dredging up feelings from But it s very confusing to me I am drinking and smoking pot less now than pretty much any point since I got un sober years ago My depression level is not crisis level They just aren t used to dealing with me regularly and I m over sharing But they have worked themselves into a nearly panicked state about me and are essentially insisting that I go back to AA if nothing else but for the fellowship I don t know if I m very Dry and worse than I realize and they are right or if this is much more complicated But if I ignore them I may really damage the relationships so I pretty much have to go to some meetings to try I speak to with a therapist x a week and a psychiatrist about quarterly They see me as not ideal but ok and I just need to do more positive stuff with my life Though I m not doing that I am in a emotional and behavior rut poor emotional sobriety but have also just had a really difficult years and lately few months I don t really think I am an alcoholic but certainty am kind of on the line there But not actively abusing And while making friends in AA does sound like it could be a huge help for me it does not really feel appropriate with that at the top of my agenda aside from appeasing my parents and sister who have decided this is the solution Thoughts ,My family is forcing me back to AA because I m depressed I was in AA for years Spent years dry or smoking pot I moved lost friends job is stressing me out mental health is not ideal Despite not smoking for a year or drinking much at all family is insisting I return mostly for friends ,1
358,I think I want to attend a meeting sometime soon I am not ready to stop drinking but I think I want to stop I don t enjoy being drunk but for me it s less worse than being sober I feel like I would prefer to just not exist at all but I really can t tell for sure what I want What s the best way to approach a first time meeting ,extremely nervous about attending a first meeting,1
359,So I tested positive for COVID on Friday and I feel absolutely terrible The problem is it feels exactly like alcohol withdrawals The sleepless nights the shivering cold sweats anxiety It s brought me right back to when I was drinking and I feel so depressed about it I m months sober working the steps with my sponsor I just wanted to share this to get it off my chest If anyone can relate I d be grateful for some words of support I know I m sober but it s like my memory is deceiving me and making me feel like I m drinking again ,I have COVID and my mental health has deteriorated so much in days,1
360,I feel so terrible After days not drinking I ve decided to have a drink with my friends to prove to myself that it s okay to have an occasional drink Long story short I got completely wasted I am frantically trying to figure out how I could have a healthy relationship with alcohol How I could just use it for socialization etc Is this really the point where I should come to the conclusion that I have an alcohol use disorder When did you realize that you had to stop Thank you for your input ,I failed and got wasted ,1
361,I m still hoping to find balance and be an in moderation wine drinker But I m becoming more open to the idea that I may be delusional I ve been trying to cut down on drinking or stop since I was I make monthly goals of how many days I want to have and less than drinks This month I set a goal of days of drinks and only allowing myself binges Problem is it s only the tenth and I ve already binged twice Maybe moderation is a delusion Maybe I need help maybe I need to reform my life in an extreme way but I don t know how, next week I always thought I d be sober or in control by now Any ideas ,1

366,My friend has an alcoholic problem but when he drinks we have some really deep talks that he keeps feeling bad to bring up I don t mind and enjoy trying to help plus understand what they re going through Why is that Alcohol just lowers your inhibitions and let s you bring up your issues easier right My friend will apologize when sober but I say I don t mind However he only does after some alcohol Is it because he really wants to talk but can t without loosening up ,Alcohol fueled deep emotion talks ,1

368,I am newly sober currently in treatment I went to a bunch of different meetings and loved all of them and met a woman at one who invited me to another of her regular meetings So I went with her but did not like the meeting It seemed more like a pickup scene to me with everyone very done up and dressed up and what seemed like flirting I also felt like people were checking me out like people check each other out at a bar or club or party whereas the other meetings I had gone to were very much come as you are low key and zero pick up vibes whatsoever So that s my first IS THIS NORMAL question Was I just in less polished I don t know exactly what word to use kinds of meetings at first or something Anyways someone at the pick up scene meeting Who knew me very casually saw me and is friends with the woman who invited me there the pick up meeting as I think of it now is her Home group I didn t recognize her because she was dressed up and wearing makeup and had her hair done and I d never seen her like that before she invited me to another meeting she goes to so I went with her On the car ride to that meeting she was kind of combative and confrontational about aa and sobriety in general in a way that felt rude and insensitive to me I ve been through hell the last few weeks with so many different things and am feeling very beat up already Her interactions with me left me feeling discouraged and attacked At the meeting she got upset with another woman and said something pretty sarcastic to her and it made me really uncomfortable But I still went out to fellowship afterwards with her and enjoyed it except for a few more sarcastic comments that were quite off putting But I actually found a woman to be my temp sponsor there That s my second IS THIS NORMAL for aa question Are some people just more aggressive about aa and sobriety because they know how serious it is to stay sober Fast forward to today and I asked the first woman I met if she was going to the meeting this week that I met her at originally because I m planning on going She said yes and that I should go to fellowship beforehand and I politely declined as I have been running a million miles an hour ever since I got sober almost weeks ago and my treatment counselor has advised me to SLOW DOWN because recovery isn t running around like a chicken with your head cut off I literally have hours of time before this meeting where I will have to opportunity to sit alone in silence with myself meditate rest and chill the fuck out I can t remember the last time I ve done that She responded telling me I have to go to fellowship because it s so important in early recovery and asked if It was a money issue I agree with her on the importance of fellowship and tried to explain how I have not had time to slow down and needed to do that before this meeting and had gone to fellowship after a meeting with the woman we both know and loved it and actually found a sponsor there She responded with a very short see you at the meeting Wtf That s my third IS THIS NORMAL for aa people question Now I don t even want to go to the meeting because I m afraid she going to try to make me feel bad for not going to the fellowship These two off putting women have been sober for many years so I want to respect them but outside of AA I would nope the hell away from these kinds of people and situations But I m also questioning myself in how I m thinking and feeling about it Help me try to put this in perspective more ,Is this normal aa behavior ,1

377,Hey guys I am four days sober and just attended my first AA meeting two days ago It was an outdoor meeting on the beach that said it was for newcomers The location was moved from where it said it was online so I ended up being like minutes late so I just sat down quietly in the back About half of the people were ripping vapes the whole meeting and the girl leading it proceeded to belligerently call out everyone who came in late about people showed up after me saying they also got lost due to the location change Then she started calling on random people who didnt want to share as it seemed it was their first time trying to force them to talk She called on my boyfriend who came with me for support and was badgering him to share He was honest and said at the beginning of the meeting you said not to share if I m under the influence of mind altering drugs I smoked weed right before I came here so I don t think I should she said no share and made him he was too sweet to say he was there for me so talked when he was really uncomfortable then there was a guy in recovery from heroine who shared who kept saying the exact location about times of where he used to score the hotel at the intersection of blank and blank is this what a meeting is typically like I just left feeling weird and bad and idk if I want to go back,First meeting,1

397,Day after three straight years of consistent alcohol abuse and I ve been drinking everyday for the last years The fact that I am makes me feel like what i m doing is okay I see all of my peers around me drinking why can t I Well because I don t know when to stop and I drink a liter of vodka a day All i m craving right now is a liter of vodka to down tonight but i m pushing through it barely I always try to stay sober but haven t been able to make it to two weeks in years I just want my passions back I want myself back I choose drinking over anything else in my life I have gained probably pounds just from my drinking Eating healthy and going to the gym is literally my only way out right now The feeling after a workout and knowing that i m sober and making progress in my body mentality and health is OVERWHELMING and gives me so much dopamine almost more than alcohol does and it s absolutely the best It s either I am a productive healthy motivated human being or i m an alcoholic I ve tried to find a balance but it s impossible for me I HAVE SELF CONTROL Once I start it just turns into benders No one else around me really understands how bad it is Both of my parents are alcoholics so it definitely runs in the family My boyfriend doesn t drink at all so that definitely helps but he also doesn t understand how I feel he s tried to help me multiple times but after seeing me always give up and give into temptation he has finally stopped and told me I have to do this on my own I would drink throughout my work day until I fell asleep at night because for some reason the way alcohol makes me feel is better than anything else can except working out It s like I have to be addicted to something and fitness would be my only other addiction Alcohol has also made me a very aggressive person attempting to ruin my relationship now and already has ruined one in the past and has also led to me being fired from a job I know to some people it may seem easy to stay off because of how much bad alcohol does bad for me in the long run and because i m so in love with working out and eating clean but i can t stop myself I drink to blackout to where I won t remember a single thing to not remember falling asleep and it s embarrassing i want it all to stop i want to get back into what i loved I think I now drink because obviously I am obsessed with the feeling but also because i m insecure I won t be insecure if i stop drinking and focus on my body and mentality but it s just a constant cycle I don t know what to do ,Will I ever reach the top ,1
398,I do know what I m going to do about it I ll get a new job they were going to have me take a urine sample I refused and got fired and stop drinking cause thankfully I don t feel like I m at the point where I can t stop My mom found out about how much I drank today she s extremely distraught by it I don t know what to say to her I ll stop drinking but alcoholism runs in the blood like Her father was an alcoholic so was my dads brother and father I don t know what to say to her I don t feel like a sorry is good enough I feel bad for making her feel this way and she told me some stuff that happened to her when she was younger because of alcohol which is untrue not the story but that it was because of alcohol and I found out my grandpas a complete piece of shit I didn t say or do anything because I didn t know what to say my dad was mouth lipping the words say something but I didn t know what to say I should ve said something but with past experience I just feel like she would ve got more upset I still didn t come completely clean about it to them I said I drank with friends and would share with them but I drink by myself Not anymore though I ve thought about quitting in the past but since I was functioning I figured the only thing I m messing up is my body ,I finally faced the consequence,1

403,The past couple weekends have gotten a little dark Last night I drank all day while my girlfriend was out with a friend Ended up at the bar and passing out in my car When my girlfriend finally got ahold of me she was pissed Rightfully so I drove home and we began to argue I ended up throwing a glass at the floor and slitting my wrist times with one of the shards I am destroying my relationship I m destroying my life once again I don t know what to do I went to meetings for awhile but I felt stupid because so many were in worse positions than me I m more of a binge drinker rather than a daily drinker Part of me feels like I push myself to hit an all time low so that I have an excuse to go get better I don t know what to do anymore It s easy to say i just won t drink anymore but that never lasts very long And once i do start drinking again it s fine for awhile but eventually escalated into something like this I m just so tired,I m an alcoholic Time and time again I go from rock bottom to doing well Recently I started drinking again on the weekends and only limiting myself to beer ,1

408,A SPIRITUAL AXIOM It is a spiritual axiom that every time we are disturbed no matter what the cause there is something wrong with us TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p I never truly understood the Tenth Step s spiritual axiom until I had the following experience I was sitting in my bedroom reading into the wee hours when suddenly I heard my dogs barking in the back yard My neighbors frown on this kind of disturbance so with mixed feelings of anger and shame as well as fear of my neighbors disapproval I immediately called in my dogs Several weeks later the exact situation repeated itself but this time because I was feeling more at peace with myself I was able to accept the situation dogs will bark and I calmly called in the dogs Both incidents taught me that when a person experiences nearly identical events and reacts two different ways then it is not the event which is of prime importance but the person s spiritual condition Feelings come from inside not from outward circumstances When my spiritual condition is positive I react positively Browse AA Online Resources https aa intergroup org oiaa resources My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist Find Next Available Meeting https aa intergroup org oiaa meetings ,Daily Reflections Oct ,1

412,Hello So I just wanted to reach out tell my story amp offer my services I do outreach free of charge amp help people get into treatment centers all across the US regardless of insurance I m just trying to share my story amp help people who many be active in addiction on the fence about what to do with their lives or know someone struggling You can message me anytime with questions if you are seeking treatment treatment for someone else or just want a friend to talk to I do not charge any money at all This is just my way of giving back amp being altruistic as that is the main thing I try to practice I welcome anyone to reach out for My email or number Before you read my story just know you do not need to have an ideal version of God or a higher power or even need to have a faith based program to be in sobriety Below is my story that I hope will help even just one person My name is Alberto I m a recovering recovered heroin addict or whatever terminology you want to use it does not matter I ve been sober since August th amp haven t looked back since I have had many years on amp off in sobriety but this time is when I finally was able to put it all behind me A little about myself is since the age of I have struggled with heroin fentanyl addiction amp many other forms of addiction Heroin was the first substance I ever touched For nearly years on amp off I was heavily in the abyss of addiction amp done every single thing in my own way to overcome this disease Of course not a single idea I thought of or plan I conjured up worked I was a mad scientist trying to bend the rules of addiction to my will but failed each amp every time It was only through acquiring a fellowship spirituality amp finding the similarities that we as addicts alcoholics share that helped me reach the moment that I know is what people described as when it comes to never wanting to use again I could talk about all the trauma amp pain I went through but none of that matters to me anymore what matters is what I did with all of that pain What I did was I was able to mold it with help amp was transformed from a victim into a survivor By really understanding what surrender is is only when my higher power amp others were able to truly help give me the gift of sobriety but not just sobriety but a life I now cherish Relapsing was more common to me than breathing if a thought of using came into my head regardless of how much time I had you could bet your life I was going to use The reason for that is because I never took the time to understand why I use I would go to meetings get a sponsor go through the steps pray to God amp even called people who I thought didn t care about me but actually did You never really understand what asking for help is like until you show people your true vulnerability When I was able to open up to people amp God about my pain trauma amp shame amongst the others things we all go through as alcoholics amp addicts is when I was able to understand the difference between being helped amp asking for help Being helped means you took the steps regardless of how uncomfortable or how vulnerable you end up Each layer to my psyche was torn apart each wall around my heart was broken down each lie I told was brought to light It was in these moments with people like yourself reading this that were able to help me understand why I use I used to escape I used out of insecurity I used because I was an empty man with nothing to fill but substances that lasted as quick as they went into me but with nothing to show for afterwards After all the work reaching out amp steps I took I was finally able to really feel spiritually fit for the first time The empty hole in my heart was not filled but mended It was mended by those regardless of what they went through how they looked age sex or skin all understood the feelings I felt Ever since I have never felt alone I was always the kid to be reluctant to give it a shot my ego was a monster that no man could tame but God is not a man No matter what you have been through people will always find a reason to help you you just have to let them Help is a nice word but the work that it entails is filled with trials amp sometimes torment that will bring you to your knees The only thing that matters is you keep moving forward amp persevering If you ever feel weak do not remember the pain you went through but remember the people who want to help you Below are some pictures of a pale boy who was lost amp almost swallowed up by hell called addiction but now that boy became a man through the help of others who understood what he was going through I am Now a man who cherishes life who yearns to be altruistic amp most importantly I smile not to mask emotions I don t want you to see but because I am generally happy Here is my Before amp After Photos Past Vs Present https i imgur com SOgNkOZ jpg ,My Story of Encouragement amp My offer to help anyone ,1

414,I posted yesterday morning about going to my first meeting on Wednesday night I received a lot of very thoughtful comments and suggestions and i want to thank everybody for that I really appreciate it I went back at noon yesterday just a couple hours after my first post because i felt like i had a lot to unload and was almost frustrated that i didn t the day before I showed up forced myself to get out of the car again went inside and sat down They asked if there were any newcomers which was obvious because there was of us in there and the other people all knew eachother lol But i raised my hand and and said yes and proceeded to have my first step meeting I explained what made me walk in there for the first time and of course balled my eyes out Everybody was extremely nice and helpful and i got a lot of phone numbers and information Today is three days since I last drank I have been trying to get out of this hole that i dug for myself with school and work and as a result my stress levels are very high I am now craving a drink more than i ever have in my life Almost like the craving is manifesting itself physically in my body for example I keep randomly getting up and pacing around without thinking about it and then realizing wtf I m doing I know i should go to a meeting or talk to somebody and i probably will but i am not worried that I am going to have a drink I just want to know how to deal with these intense cravings I ve never had them like this before ,Day three,1

416,Hi everyone As many of us know there has been a brief history of psychedelic substances involved in the early formative years of AA Here is a quick explanation on the correspondence between Bill W and Carl Jung around the usage of psychedelic drugs and twelve step work Some of my AA friends and I have taken the material LSD frequently and with much benefit Wilson told Jung adding that the powerful psychedelic drug sparks a great broadening and deepening and heightening of consciousness Wilson told Jung that his first LSD trip in reminded him of a mystical revelation he had after hitting bottom in the s and winding up in a New York City hospital ward for hardcore alcoholics My original spontaneous spiritual experience of twenty five years before was enacted with wonderful splendor and conviction he wrote LSD was still legal in and in Wilson s case initially taken under the medical supervision of UCLA researcher Sidney Cohen and with the spiritual guidance of his Wilson s friend Gerald Heard an Anglo Irish mystic and early proponent of psychedelic spirituality Wilson would go on to quietly form a bi coastal psychedelic salon with various leading lights of that decade including the writer Aldous Huxley Wilson s earlier spiritual experience occurred in December of before LSD was even invented It happened during Wilson s fourth and final stay at a private New York City hospital that employed something called the Towns Lambert Cure to treat their alcoholic clients Many of these patients including Wilson were once successful businessmen whose drinking had spun out of control during the Great Depression Suddenly Bill would later recall my room blazed with an indescribably white light I was seized with an ecstasy beyond description That room was in a rehab center where doctors employed a potion which included two drugs derived from plants known to cause delirium and hallucinations One of them is belladonna and the other henbane was long associated with witchcraft and potions said to summon the spirits of the dead Warning to psychonaunts both of these plants can be poisonous at high doses Apparently Carl Jung would come to pass before responding to Bills second letter I would never share this in a meeting format but after years of sobriety I developed a severe autoimmune disease and lost the ability to walk after a few years of trying various mainstream medical treatments with no real progress I turned to alternative treatment methods One of which was a shamanic ceremony where I ingested the psychedelic drug Iboga Afterwards my symptoms subsided nearly This past year I have been able to manage my chronic Lyme inflammation and mobility symptoms with continued micro dosing of psychedelic drugs I take micro amounts of psilocybin mushrooms and iboga root days out of the week It s helped me tremendously in the realm of autoimmunity but I have largely kept my mouth shut about it in twelve step circles At times I have wondered if I am putting my recovery at risk doing this The truth is that I feel much better physically and mentally when using these medicines My spiritual life and the conscious contact I have with my higher power feels stronger than ever This sort of thing still automatically raises an alarm in my brain and I find myself thinking I am using a chemical to control how I feel And this raises the natural suspicion if what I m doing is healthy or not I m not so much interested in anyone s personal theoretical opinions but I ve wondered if anyone out there in step internet land has any actual experience strength or hope around the subject Thanks ,Microdosing in recovery Bill W Carl Jung and early psychedelic usage in AA history ,1
417,I m early into sobriety again and I know statistically speaking my chances for success increase if I go to meetings and work a program I just can t get over the cult religious vibe I get there Everything is so ritualistic and stiff and it seems like everyone s high on the Bill W Kool aid I enjoy hearing people s strength and hope and I buy into a lot of the philosophy and steps I just disagree with some aspects of the program But it seems like any deviation from full indoctrination makes me a failure before I ve began as I m trying to find an easier softer way and you re considered non committal by members who ve been around longer and fully bought in I like being independent and autonomous and I can t help but wonder how much personal growth I m truly experiencing if I m just shutting my mouth and nodding my head and living life in a way that s laid out by something outside of myself Is there no gray area The sentiment that anyone who is sober but not following the program is secretly miserable and deluding themselves is a big red flag to me But it s a prevalent opinion when you walk through those doors Anyone whose made it another day sober has accomplished a great feat whether they did it through there own willpower and determination found support in family or friends God or through AA I don t think one way is easier or more right than another But what do I know I m early in recovery like I said Let me know what y all think or what I m missing here I m willing to go to meetings but I just feel bad participating when I m not genuinely committed ,Is there anyway I could reframe my view of AA ,1

419,DAILY INVENTORY and when we were wrong promptly admitted it ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS p I was beginning to approach my new life of sobriety with unaccustomed enthusiasm New friends were cropping up and some of my battered friendships had begun to be repaired Life was exciting and I even began to enjoy my work becoming so bold as to issue a report on the lack of proper care for some of our clients One day a co worker informed me that my boss was really sore because a complaint submitted over his head had caused him much discomfort at the hands of his superiors I knew that my report had created the problem and began to feel responsible for my boss s difficulty In discussing the affair my co worker tried to reassure me that an apology was not necessary but I soon became convinced that I had to do something regardless of how it might turn out When I approached my boss and owned up to my hand in his difficulties he was surprised But unexpected things came out of our encounter and my boss and I were able to agree to interact more directly and effectively in the future Browse AA Online Resources https aa intergroup org oiaa resources My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist Find Next Available Meeting https aa intergroup org oiaa meetings ,Daily Reflections Oct ,1

435, So I m going in my first days of sobriety I love the aa program and have made some good friends My first week I started going to aa I had a lady in her s come up to me and saw that I was a mess and she offered to be my sponsor She came up to me and asked if I had one and I said no and she said oh well not anymore I m gonna be your sponsor I thought it was a little strange because I thought we were suppose to ask people but I was grateful that she offered so I can get started on the steps She was really good she has years of sobriety and I can tell she knows her stuff she also has a lot of Sponses So she gave me a packet to work on and started working the steps As time went on she would make comments about how being a hair dresser isn t a real career I ve been a hair dresser for years now and gave me tons of shit about smoking a nicotine vape pen as I m trying to quit smoking cigarettes I kind blew it off because I know she s an old timer and just wants what is best for me But things just started to get worse if I had to go to a clients hair at their house I m just doing it on the side right now because I want to be stable in my recovery before I get a real job and if I couldn t make a meeting because of it she said she didn t want me missing meetings I currently am going to meetings minimum every week and whenever I miss one I make it up and I m also in an intense outpatient program on top of that I was suppose to meet at her house a few weeks ago and I was waiting outside her door for almost an hour as she wasn t answering the door I confirmed with her the day before she ended up calling me a few hours later and said she was getting X rays done at the doctor I was a little irritated because she didn t even let me know she was doing that and we confirmed the day before Whenever I talk to her about personal stuff I ve had tragic deaths in my life recently and my best friend is currently out using drugs Also there s a lot of family drama in my life that I try to stay out of but I m involved because it is my family she just tells me it s none of my business and just to let it go She also says I need to get over people that died and stuff happens and she s seen tons of people die and you can t let it effect you I understand where she s coming from as a sponsor but those things are easier said and done I recently went to an nfl football game on Sunday with my boyfriend and his dad I normally go to a Sunday night meeting but my sponsor doesn t attend that one We got stuck in a ton of traffic on the way back from the game and we didn t get home till late on the way back she texted me and said she was going to be at that meeting and she ll see me there I told her I was stuck in traffic and wouldn t be going and I had no idea she was even going to go to that meeting She ignored me and the next day she was upset with me because she said she went to the meeting just for me and didn t show up She also questioned why I would even go to a football game during Covid and to never do it again I explained to her I am vaccinated and I actually had a good time and was proud of myself because it was the first event I ve gone to sober and didn t drink She just kept telling me to not go again I also have been wanting to try an NA meeting that my friends from my out patient group goes too because they are all about my age but I m scared to tell her because she thinks alcoholics shouldn t be going to an NA Meeting and visa versa Long story short I think I want to change sponsers but I don t know how to go about it I feel like if I talk to her about how I feel she s just gonna get upset because she s so set in her ways She is a nice lady but I m starting to get anxiety whenever I talk to her because I don t want to say the wrong thing I don t want to have to change my home group because of this but but I m horrible at confrontation Any advice on how to go about this situation Over all I love aa I love the steps and the big book I feel like it s helping I just feel like My Sponsor isn t right for me Sorry about the long post I appreciate anyone that has read this ,I don t know how to go about changing sponsors,1

437,Another major problem I have with support groups is that when you speak and tell the others about your struggles and experiences No one else is allowed to talk or give any feedback I feel like there are people in the room who ve had similar issues and have constructive advice and suggestions but are forbidden from speaking I find myself still struggling and wishing someone would provide answers I get discouraged and end up quitting What are your thoughts Why is AA and other groups structured like this ,No Cross Talking or Feedback,1

443,I apologize for the length of this post I went to my first AA meeting last night I m years old and was the youngest person there by a long shot I was coming off of the worst bender of my life that lasted from last Thursday to this Wednesday morning when i laid on my couch in my apartment for hours in a state of complete withdrawal I sat in the back for the whole hour and didn t say a word I really wanted to speak up but i was barely holding myself together and i knew that i would start balling my eyes out if i even tried to start talking I know not sharing at meetings is okay but i could tell that most of the people there could tell i was a newbie and wanted me to say something but they weren t about to make me uncomfortable or anything which i appreciated I ve always been the person in my friend groups that gets the most fucked up incoherent and does some of the worst shit a person can do while fucked up I m embarrassed to say that i really can t remember a single minute of Monday Tuesday I m a college student in my last semester and i didn t go to class or work either of those days because for some reason i decided what was best for me was to keep the bender going and i just sat on my couch drinking a fifth of Jaeger I come from a long line of good people that are really bad alcoholics on both sides of my family and i really feel like i have disappointed them tremendously This day period in which i was fucked up almost nonstop wasn t the first such occasion that I ve done that but i do believe it was the worst and the longest and i don t ever want to go through the hell of what i did Wednesday morning as well as the shame and embarrassment of my actions for myself and my family I don t really know what else to say at the moment But if anyone reads this and can provide some insight and advice i would really appreciate it ,Went to my first meeting last night,1

446,Hey guys I m years old I usually have or drinks before bed every night This isn t usually enough to make me hungover but I have tend to drink pretty heavily on the weekends I get terrible anxiety when I m hungover No headaches just random panic attacks about absolutely nothing I drank heavily Wednesday through Sunday last week which isn t typical for me Monday morning I had to pull over separate times during a minute drive due to my anxiety I haven t taken a sip of alcohol in hours but still had panic attacks frequently yesterday today and have only gotten about hours of sleep total the past two nights so I believe these are alcohol withdrawals I ve accepted that I need to slow down on my drinking and have proven to myself the past few days that I m capable of doing it My question to you guys is this Let s say the withdrawal symptoms are gone on Friday If I drink on Saturday not heavily of course will the withdrawals come right back the next morning or would I have a clean slate to work with Thanks everyone,Withdrawal question,1

453,Hey everyone When I was a teenager young adult I had some pretty severe alcohol drug abuse problems I never wanted to label myself an addict but I did eventually get sober after hitting rock bottom Then I improved my life and got started on a career years later I still drank though It took a lot of practice but I switched to beer instead of liquor And most of the time I was too busy to drink At most I would go out binge drinking once a week while in college And yes I was disappointed in myself that I still had little self control when going out with friends Fast forward to today I am fresh out of a divorce have little connection to my family and it s getting too late for me to ever have my own kids one day I have a hard time imagining myself in another relationship because I always choose abusive men So it s really not worth it And now I have nothing to live for I have been drinking everyday getting shitfaced every weekend night I love it when people cancel their plans on me so I can just drink in private instread But I had a stern talking too by my friend Saying I need therapy and I agreed I would go But I kind of don t want to I already know that I will go and they ll tell me to stop drinking And I don t want to What then I don t know where I am supposed to find the motivation when there isn t anything nice in my life right now ,What if I really don t want to quit ,1
454,I recently admitted to myself that I am not just really into cannabis but SO into it that it s ruining my life Originally I thought NA might be the right fit but given the unique set of issues Ontario s legalization of weed causes for those of us that have a problem with it I feel like that s more similar in some ways to challenges an alcoholic might face like accessibility for example alcohol and weed are both very very accessible here We have more than LCBO locations in our small town AND two beer stores There s also more than pot dispensaries here The last thing I want to do is take away from anyone else s spaces by being somewhere I shouldn t be but I m struggling to even get one day sober and I want to try going to meetings I just need to know which one makes the most sense I suppose Is AA only for alcoholics and I should be looking at NA Thanks ,Am I in the right place ,1

456,It s very easy to hide I never come to work drunk or smell like booze I ll take one nip on my lunch break to curb withdrawal then I wash it down with coffee so it won t be on my breath Then I leave work hit the gym days a week and go home to my wife and kids The only thing is I secretly get drunk to sleep after my wife and I either make love or watch tv before bed She can t ever tell because I ll chase my liquor with Gatorade and then I brush my teeth before bed How is it so easy to hide this I m too ashamed to admit this to anyone in real life,I m a teacher and an alcoholic,1

462, Hello I m an alcoholic who previously had been to a detox center This has been probably years now Since then I do okay I don t know that I m your typical AA alcoholic as I managed to get into social drinking in the last year or two and seemed to be relatively okay After getting out of the detox center I stayed away for quite sometime and then found myself occasionally going out and getting plastered This would happen maybe once every month Since then I cleaned that up quite a bit drink maybe times a month and not much at all I also go to the gym and practice fitness and healthy eating I really thought I had it all turned around Last Thursday I was in a wedding and I drank with the wedding party and had maybe Felt fine but hungover the next day Friday I drank at the wedding as well I really screwed up I m certain I had over drinks spirits to myself which implies a ml bottle of liquor or more I also woke up the next morning and drank more purely for the pain I haven t drank since so today is day with no alcohol and no intention of continuing I didn t eat at all Saturday and Sunday and have been doing my best with water intake daily since but it s been averaging around oz per day and I m lbs and usually drink around oz of water I started going back to the gym on Monday This is the second time this has happened this year and the last time it did it was only one night I was hungover for at least days It is the same this time too however in looking up symptoms like tingling arms and just general flu like symptoms I came across alcoholic neuropathy Right now I have a slight tingling in my arms and just some brain fog and some tremors If I remember right the only other time this happened this year it went away after days I did not know about AN at that time and I m now afraid I ve caused myself an issue and am worried that I should seek medical attention In regard to my habits I had everyone convinced including myself that I was no longer a problem So much for that huh Luckily since I got out of detox I have developed a habit of being able to not drink so as long as I don t attend the wrong events I won t drink by myself or at home or anything like that So moving forward from here won t be difficult as I typically don t even have cravings or urges I just wrongly convinced myself that I was able to handle something I m not and instead of manifesting itself in daily drinking it all came out in a hr period Let me know what you think I m really nervous about this ,Can a severe night of binge drinking cause alcoholic neuropathy ,1

468,FACING OURSELVES and Fear says You dare not look TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p How often I avoided a task in my drinking days just because it appeared so large Is it any wonder even if I have been sober for some time that I will act that same way when faced with what appears to be a monumental job such as a searching and fearless moral inventory of myself What I discover after I have arrived at the other side when my inventory is completed is that the illusion was greater than the reality The fear of facing myself kept me at a standstill and until I became willing to put pencil to paper I was arresting my growth based on an intangible Browse AA Online Resources https aa intergroup org oiaa resources My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist Find Next Available Meeting https aa intergroup org oiaa meetings ,Daily Reflections Oct ,1

470,I have a question for more experienced people than I about how Steps works specifically about making amends My husband s ex wife is currently going through the steps and claims that she has completed them and has become a sponsor However she never made any effort to make amends to our family and when asked she said she was making living amends because she didn t have to make direct amends if it would hurt somebody and it would hurt her In all the research I did it said direct amends are best unless it hurts the person you re making amends to It would not hurt us at all she knows it and we were looking forward to finally having an honest conversation with her She definitely knows that amends are needed at the very least to the kids that she abandoned due to her addiction Am I just completely misunderstanding what it means to make amends I thought an apology is supposed to hurt the person making it that s the entire point of admitting you did something wrong and you feel sorry for it Thank you for any insight you can bring me ,Question from someone on the outside about the steps,1

481,Today I hit one year sober I m part of me feels like it s pathetic that at years old I m already one year sober That at so young I had a problem and had to choose sobriety if I wanted to survive In September of I got black out drunk and fought cops that was my rock bottom I knew something had to change From the second I turned to that point at I was essentially drunk every night If I couldn t hide the night drinking I d day drink and walk around I functioned I could function but without the promise of alcohol I felt there was no reason to live When I hit my rock bottom I met a paramedic who changed my life and perspective on things He showed me there was more to life then getting shit faced I had my last hoorah on October of course it was day drinking Well morning drinking I got plastered on the steps of the courthouse I m missing most of that day but I remember sobering up at McDonald s At roughly pm I was sober I promised myself when I started drinking that day to only have enough to enjoy That s the last time I got drunk or even had a drop of alcohol It s pm October and I am proud to say I am year sober One whole year sober I ll be honest I didn t think it was possible It still scares me what if I relapse after getting this far What if I fail everyone It s scary but at least I can say is that in this moment I did it Now I KNOW I can do it I hope I don t slip but it s one day at a time Thank you for all of you who has supported me and helped me on days I ve struggled I hope everyone the best in their sobriety , year,1
482,I stayed up all night drinking again At am I finally searched for AA meetings near me I m super sporadic and chaotic when I m drinking so I left the house even though it didn t start for another and a half hours I hit the gas station and bought a tall boy Turns out the meeting didn t start until am To kill time I went to my sister in law s place and helped her take her son to school Thank GOD she was awake She actually ended up going to the meeting with me When we got there it was exactly what I remembered from when I was in rehab being forced to attend AA A bunch of old geezers who all knew each other but this time I was there by choice and everyone was soooo kind and welcoming Meeting one of the women was really special for me In minutes of meeting each other she was hugging me and I just broke down in tears I guess because I felt hopeful for once I know the meetings alone do not keep you sober but for once I finally felt like I had the ability to let go of this chain on my life Everyone at that meeting this morning read passages that stuck with both my sister in law and me They didn t urge us to think of recovery with God in a religious way and that s great because we re very spiritual in a different way I was white faced emotional hadn t slept in hours drunk as piss head throbbing and I look over at my sister and see her wiping tears and knew that we were both meant to be there today I m happy I made this choice and when I came home my husband told me how proud he was of me Here s to about hours sober I hope there s many more to come What I m telling myself right now is that even though I see literally everyone relapse at some point I can t use that as an excuse to drink again Like oh it s okay I can drink tonight and start my journey again tomorrow because I really have that tendency to give myself any excuse to drink Hell I ll drink to not drinking So stupid So right now I m working on deciding if I should cancel upcoming parties I m hosting and events I m going to because alcohol is everywhere in my life I m not sure if being around it right now is a good idea even though I d like to think I could resist I ve also been reminding myself that I hate who I am when I drink I don t have to be her anymore By the way I m mom of two and I m proud of myself ,I went to my second first meeting today,1
483,I am working through Step s at the moment and I am finding that a lot of them are negatively received The feed back seems to be that it is an imposition an exacting of energy from the person being apologised too that it is selfish IE all about making me feel better and that there is something weak about it because it is a convention of steps and therefore not personal or heartfelt I have been searching opinions online and it seems that this is a common opinion out there from people that have been approached by those in recovery seeking to make amends to them What are your thoughts on this I will keep on making my amends and there are those that take them with tolerance and grace but I am interested in hearing people s reflections on the criticism and also how they make peace with it ,Step s negatively received ,1

485,Hello everyone I posted here a couple of days ago and everyone was extremely kind and generous with advice thank you so much I m hoping for a couple of further tips please if anyone has any My mental health team who I have been under the care of for one year major depression and suicide attempt have referred me today to the substance abuse alcoholism team Apparently it will take about weeks for them to get in touch I asked about attending AA meetings but for now they have advised to try their professionals first I have not ruled out AA and still very open to attending in future For now I am looking for some tips for how to get to at least one day of sobriety In the past I had reasons not to drink although that hasn t always been enough to stop me because the next day I needed to work exercise class etc But these days depression has wiped my motivation I m out of work I basically lie in bed as much as possible which I am not proud of Drinking is about the only thing I look forward to I feel if I can crack one day of not drinking here and there it will be easier for me to be productive on and off over the coming weeks I am supposed to be studying for the last year of my degree as a mature student which started on Saturday But I haven t even looked at it It is flexible learning so I don t have a fixed schedule unlike a traditional university This is something that should be motivating me to get sober but isn t Essentially I am looking for tips as to how to beat the craving Today I promised myself I would not drink but once evening came around again I did it How to combat these cravings I have heard of surf the urge but I always automatically dismiss it in my head I was planning to distract myself tonight by watching a TV show but the temptation was too great TL DR Advice for cravings urges please ,Getting to day of sobriety ,1
486,Hello y all ill keep it short My roommate hit year sober through AA about months ago He seems to have subbed seltzer water in for beers and it works for him from what I can see I think it is worth noting that I sometimes have beer in the house and I made triply sure he was cool with it I have a deal with him to put a mini fridge in my room or not to have any if it truly became a problem no questions asked So far so good months He recently asked me if I was doing no booze October which I am He showed me a pic of some brewery that puts out a non alcoholic IPA and to see if our local place had it next time i went I immediately got a sinking feeling in my stomach imagining this is probably nothing but bad news Although I have had some struggles with alcohol I ve never needed rehab or to permanently abstain I can t imagine that if it came to that point I would want to have near beers around me He s a grown man so I don t want to impose on him by telling him to ask his sponsor first I m genuinely not sure how that works So I m asking you guys should I pretend to have forgotten and hope he does too Or should I get them for him Thank you for your replies in advance , year sober roommate wants me to buy him IPAs Terrible idea ,1

490,My husband is in rehab First time long time alcoholic He went willingly I expected his case manager to spend time talking to us about his departure from teh facility I expected the facility to communicate with his psyciatrist and therapist they work as a team I have had to push HARD to get that communication to happen My biggest concern being the facility wants to release my husband earlier than his therapist and psyhciatrist think they should I understand this is my husbands decision but he says he is open to have the conversation with his Dr and the facility staff I expected the facilty to communicate with the family about post release plans About strategies if we suspect a relapse I am meeting with active agression from his case manager as to what she sees as my questioning her credentials It s to the point where I realize there s no point in my talking to this person anymore My husband isn t helpful becuase while he agreed to talk to his therapist he s obviously not eager to prolong his stay I get that I just feel like the facility is going through the motions But this is where I am Any advice on opening the lines of communication with the facility Though I suspect that s not going to happen So more importantly any advice for supporting someone as they leave inpatient treatment I started al anon He says he plans to go to AA meetings I am really troubled by the differing opinions between his psychaitrist and the facilty and just the not knowing what s next Thank you,Rehab expectations Providing support ,1

524,After working the steps and getting honest for the first time ever I realized that I used medical professionals to justify my drinking drug abuse Basically the epitome of the if you had my life you would drink like I drink syndrome I had an alcoholic father that was the kind to tell my mother that if she left him he d kill all of us So we ran around the country hiding during my childhood New schools every few months because he would find us etc I saw a lot of violence blah blah So my mom tried her best to help me and had me seeing counselors really young I learned right away these counselors show sympathy for you when you tell them things They told me I ve seen too much That im traumatized That im different than normal healthy kids and im going to need ongoing treatment likely forever As I grew up I was diagnosed with more and more PTSD bi polar disorder depression borderline personality disorder anxiety and panic attacks They even told me that I had a chemical imbalance That i lacked the natural feel good chemicals normal people have And I was prescribed more and more People with fancy degrees assuring me that I have valid medical and psychological issues requiring chemical treatment Shit Thats all you had to say Of course if I have to be medicated to live through all my mental issues and chemical imbalances I may as well be the one to choose which meds make me feel better The ones they prescribed really never did much for me After much experimentation I settled on liquor being the most effective chemical solution It was the only thing that worked AND it was all natural legal easy to get and didn t require a prescription and dependence on the medical industrial complex Win win Then I drank to a point of dependency where when they separated me from liquor I had a seizure respiratory failure delirium tremens and had to use a walker to learn to walk again Liquor quit working and I was out of options The plan was to go to AA a bit to show my family that I at least tried something before drinking myself to death A little over a year sober and I recently got to step with my sponsor I finally got honest Im not crazy Im just a drunk I don t have PTSD just been through a bit more drama than some Drama not trauma I needed a spiritual solution not a chemical solution this whole time When I stopped living in the problem and started living in the solution the problem went away Thanks AA ,Anyone else justify their drinking by means of doctors amp psychiatrists ,1

534,Hi I consider myself a problem drinker but not sure if it means I m an alcoholic as such I ve always used alcohol as a crutch in an unhealthy way At one time when I was younger I used to drink all day including before and during work to combat social anxiety Over the years I ve noticed that I drink more than my peers and in bad times drink quite a lot most nights of the week But then again there have been months and years where I ve not been a problem drinker at all drinking similar amounts as others or much less and only at weekends Over the past year I ve been drinking a lot at weekends sometimes everyday getting drunk in the early evening and my family have expressed concern After that happened I did manage to reduce it to about times per week and drinking a bit less But over the last couple of months I ve been drinking every day with a few days off in the last couple of weeks I m out of work at the moment so no routine or motivation not to drink About a bottle of wine and a half each evening It s not huge amounts but I don t think it s healthy and it is effecting me the next day eg super hangover I don t have the shakes or anything like that and I don t believe any kind of physical addiction Would you say I m an alcoholic Also I am currently under psychiatric support for major depression and suicide attempt I see a professional once a week to discuss my treatment and progress A number of times over the past year they have asked if I d like to be referred to the alcohol support workers I ve always declined as I ve not felt I m at that point and also feel a bit embarrassed seeking alcohol support when I m only drinking a bottle and a half of wine a night I know some people can drink a lot throughout the day so would feel like I was wasting the professionals time who could be helping others who are having a tougher time Do you think I should be referred A bit long sorry TL DR am I an alcoholic Should I speak to substance abuse professionals Thanks ,At what point do you cross the line and are actually an alcoholic Also a question about professional support,1

543,Content warning for obvious reasons including relapse bodily harm and fire Someone I know from the program relapsed and while they were high not long ago they set themself on fire accidentally They burned their entire face part of their arm and their hand I guess they were setting something on fire and accidentally switched up their lighter fluid container with a container of gasoline and they caught fire They could ve died Their face looked terribly injured obviously They have gone through several procedures like skin grafts already and their injuries and appearance have come a long way but they do not look the same and I can t imagine they will ever really look like what they did before setting themself on fire I will say they look the best I ve ever seen someone with that intense of facial burns look after reconstructive surgery or whatever procedures were done so they are lucky for that and that they are safe and didn t die Still of course no one wants to go through that and that s got to be a horrifically traumatic thing to go through and live with for the rest of your life This is what relapse looks like though This could be any of us if we don t get and stay sober Things don t stay like they were the last time you drank or used They don t get better It s not chill They always get worse and usually they get worse much faster than the time before Alcoholics and addicts cannot learn to use or drink in a normal social safe way We cannot I ve tested it and failed The first time I got sober I thought maybe I wasn t realllyyyyy an alcoholic because I hadn t gone to jail ruined a marriage lost a career etc I went back out and then guess what happened I ended up going to jail separate times when I was because I got duis a couple months apart I was lucky I didn t hurt somebody else or myself or crash I m sure that would ve been in my not so distant future had I not been stripped of my ability to drive then gotten sober I ve been sober thanks to my higher power my people and this program for years You all can do it too Really if I can you can too I was fucked There s plenty of times I could ve died Back to the person with burn accident They ve got several kids What s next after you burn your fucking face off When is it enough Now the hospital is giving them heavy drugs for their pain which I m sure they honestly need right now but will this be their wakeup call I know them pretty well and sadly I don t think so It might be one of the many wakeup calls they ve had through the years where they try again for a bit and then relapse again in a few months or a year I kind of doubt they aren t driving their kids around while they re high Will they get into a wreck while high with their kids in the car I sure as fuck hope not but these are the thoughts and worries you have about someone when they re already at the point where they ve accidentally burned their face off while high They are a person who has probably been to rehab about times at this point over more than a decade I m pretty sure I used to be their sponsor so I know what they re like and why they haven t stayed sober They made excuses all the time from the very beginning on why they can t do meetings in days for example They didn t give their all and put their heart and soul into their steps They re a bullshitter They lash out and cast people out of their lives when they try to tell them the truth for their own good They surround themselves with yes men who oftentimes use them They are not rigorously honest They seem so self deluded that they believe their own lies even when they re sober and of course more when they re not sober I m sure They ve lost custody of their kids before And those kids are fucking awesome This person is also fucking awesome when they want to be and are fully capable of succeeding being a great parent and going on to help other people and live a good life but they have not done the things they need to do to stay sober Don t take that path I beg you It breaks my fucking heart I m not sharing this to shame anyone or any actions I know this is a horrible and debilitating disease and I made my fair share of awful decisions that hurt myself and others before I got sober Hell I ve done some dumbass shit in sobriety too but I have kept moving forward and growing and doing the shit I need to do to stay sober and make progress This is seriously a simple program Yes it can be hard as hell sometimes but if you make excuses and don t keep going you will pay the price and so will the people who love you I just wanted to share this because this news has shaken me to my core and it has reminded me of the reality of this disease and made me even more grateful to still be sober The tragedies we and others go through are awful but they are the truth of the disease of alcoholism and addiction and we have to remember that Let them be a lesson and a time to check in with ourselves and be grateful for what we have TLDR Someone I know relapsed and accidentally set themself on fire while high and burned their entire face They could ve died They re an awesome person when they want to be when they re sober but they are a chronic relapsed because they don t do the work to stay sober This could be me or any of us if we relapsed The consequences of this disease are absolutely brutal and just get worse and worse each time we relapse or the longer we keep drinking Please do what you need to do because you can get and stay sober I ve been sober years Pretty much anyone can do it if they work the program Don t let yourself and your loved ones go through anymore tragedy because of alcohol or drugs ,CW Relapsed and set themself on fire while high,1

556,On the I will be one month alcohol free I ve known I was an alcoholic since I was about I m almost now I never really understood the sobriety thing until my life became unmanageable I had many sobriety dates and many benders after I feel good without it but I don t feel like I m completely done I feel guilty saying that but this is the first time I just stopped drinking without seeking help or planning to stop I just stopped Which means it probably won t last I m confused with myself and I feel very alone Everyone in my life is an alcoholic family included They drink ALL of the time but it s so normal to them they would never stop or see it the way it really is ,Feeling alone,1
557,I am unsure if this is the right place to post but hopefully someone can help I m a year old female I ve been classified as an alcoholic since April is this year I was recently given naltrexone I took it on Thursday of this past week and wow I will never take it again It made me irritable Like I ve never experienced before It also made me very weak and super tired I haven t told my phycologist yet because I don t think they ll believe me What is your experience with this med ,Naltrexone and new to AA,1
558,I did quit AA once right at weeks sober I was really working the program during that time taking it seriously Working the steps with my sponsor leading meetings listening to audiobooks etc But I was missing something from Step I was willing to admit my life had become unmanageable but I had doubts about being powerless over alcohol I thought I could go back to it and it would be fun for the holidays What ensured once I picked up the drink again was nothing but pain and remorse From the very first night to days later when I nearly died Then I became convinced that I was powerless over drinking and I got the impression the Universe was making sure I had no mistakes about it During that time I wrote down everything that went wrong it was pages of negative things and disasters Starting with my son crying because I did not get the week chip I feel a loss when people tell me they did AA for x months to a year and quit going to meetings because they don t drink anymore They believe they re all better I know what that feels like but the truth is recovery takes time For me I had to learn to live my life sober to beat back the anxieties of life To finally be able to sit quietly with me without reaching for a drink or a drug or some other addictive filler shopping eating obsessive behaviors overfocusing on things too much work too much exercise For me there is a second part of the AA program where my life got immensely better The barbaric behavior went away and I started looking after others Anxiety and malaligned behaviors were my biggest challenge Next year will be years sober before the incident s This whole past year has been filled with an intuition that only the Universe could provide I reclaimed my career after two years of searching My immediate family doesn t drink anymore because of what happened I m helping my sister get sober I amended relationships and those people went off to mend ties with their old friends It s been the AA Promises I often say I m learning to live my life sober but I think it takes time to see it To get to that point where the things I learned in AA extend way beyond just not reaching for a drink but onto having an amazing life ,They say Don t quit before the miracle happens ,1

571,I finally came to a realization that I am an alcoholic It all started years ago I was what you can call a high functioning alcoholic I fell into a deep depression after having my last child My last two are only months apart and being the only one to care for them really took a toll on me mentally And so I turned to drinking in the shadows I had bottles hidden in the apt my car In random cups to disguise that I was drinking No one really knew because I still handled tasks in my day to day life Over the course of the years I was drinking on and off Was able to quit for months last year while quitting with my then boyfriend but eventually with our break up life stresses and chaos I picked up that bottle again Living on my own it became even worse because I sat alone in my thoughts and I lost the will power to stay focused in workouts and I let alcohol consume me and ruin my friendships my family my work and my relationship My life became unmanageable I moved out of state months ago and being away from all my family took a toll on me daily There came the alcohol the only thing to comfort and numb me in the shadows I isolated myself to my room and drank every night and day letting depression and anxiety keep me down I let alcohol once again take control of me whether I was alone or surrounded by my kids I had the desire to quit I was missing out on so much in life including being present in my children s I mentioned it to my family that I wanted to quit Earlier this week I came out of work to a letter from my son with a picture of my kids In the letter he s talking about how he and his siblings are there for me and how proud he is of me for making the decision to move here for all my hard work at work and at home and for the then days I didn t have a drink It was his letter and appreciation and acknowledgment of my efforts that helped me walk through the doors of my first AA meeting yesterday It was the best thing I could ve done I felt welcomed and my heart at peace to hear everyone else share their stories and to be able to relate to each person One person said we are here to help you on your journey only you can love and help yourself first and if you don t love yourself we will all love you and be here for you to support you until you learn to I received my first sobriety chip and it was the best feeling in the world I have now made it through one week and have been to AA meetings A woman I met who is years sober has been texting me to encourage the meetings and has been nothing but great support I have not yet found a sponsor but that will be my next step Grateful for the fellowship of my new found AA family My heart amp soul feel at peace and I finally feel like I m on the right path Good luck to anyone who struggles There are so many resources out there to help on your journey Hope you all have a great week ,Week ,1
572,I ve never had trouble staying away from alcohol for long periods of time but when I do drink I majorly over do it which is why I consider myself to be an alcoholic I ve made the decision not to drink anymore at all I ve decided to work through the steps with a therapist instead of going to meetings because I have extreme social anxiety and after going to meetings I don t think it will work for me It just has not been easy for me to even attempt to share in front of people I will not go into why because I don t think it is going to add any information necessary to the advice I am asking for I m worried that my mom who has been in the program for a very lengthy amount of time will be disappointed in this decision I ve made I ve spoken to my doctor about it and he thinks this will work best for me as well as he has always been aware of my other mental health problems and is my primary care physician I would appreciate any advice on how to relay this to my mother without feeling like I m disappointing her as that tends to be a trigger of a lot of anxiety for me I know this decision is right for me but I also know she thinks the only way is AA Any insights to how this may make her feel or any advice you ve given to someone in a similar situation is appreciated ,Advice about deciding against the meetings but still working the steps,1

576,Today I have five months sober from alcohol and benzodiazepenes Here is a little back story A few years ago my little brother was killed in a farming accident right before I entered law school This led to a series of events that would include to me drinking a fifth or two of hard liquor everyday combined with around mg of Xanax or mg of Klonopin I was also doing MDMA times a week and occasionally smoking crack and meth I did this on a daily basis save for the occasional week or two of guilt related abstinence Inevitably I lost my scholarship and was reprimanded for frequently going to lectures under the influence My fiancee left me and I accidentally overdosed on a Xanax laced with fentanyl in August of This was still not enough for me to stop I was essentially in a semi permanent state of blackout my ability to plan reason or even remember basic details about important events was almost non existent I struggled to maintain employment and got to the point where I was isolating from the few remaining people that I hadn t alienated After a couple failed stints in rehab this all came to a head when in April while on my way to cover a baseball game for the local newspaper I got a DUI I blew a and was promptly fired So then I unsuccessfully tried to drink myself to death Once I had drained my bank accounts into the red I didn t know what to do Out of money friends food booze and pills I knew if I was going to continue to live I needed to get help Luckily I found a halfway house a couple hours away that my insurance covered who said they would admit me The problem was it required hours of sobriety So the next day I found a ride lied about how long I had sober and checked myself in I had the experience of going through extreme withdrawal without the aid of any medication over the next couple weeks Eventually I leveled out and I was surprised when my mind cleared a lot quicker than I expected I became dedicated to my recovery and attended the meetings in days that so many AA s deem essential After three months I had secured a decent paying and stable job working at the corporate office of a bank I got my own apartment and moved out of the halfway house My DUI got dismissed on a technicality and my license was reinstated I even got admitted into graduate school at the local university to get my MBA in Accounting But the thing is I started smoking weed again a couple months ago I live fairly close to a dispensary Having PTSD and chronic pain from a motorcycle accident some years ago it seems to be the one thing other than alcohol which gives me psychological relief I know this is frowned upon but I gotta say it s working I feel a lot more grounded and less depressed While I have heard countless stories about people relapsing on their drug drink of choice after resuming cannabis usage I have not had that desire whatsoever This choice has led to issues related to my local AA circle After telling my girlfriend in confidence she broke up with me over it and started telling people I had relapsed at meetings when I wasn t there Friendships have ended and I have been lying about it to my sponsor to avoid judgment I feel like this response is counter intuitive to the purpose of AA of which the only requirement is a desire to stop drinking which I did Now I m in a position where I need to choose between my own mental health or acting like a had some big relapse to appease these fair weather friends in the program Truth be told I m a little disgusted It all comes off as disingenuous where uncompromising adherence to the accepted status quo not even principles or steps is required for support and acceptance and I m not about that I don t think I should have to change what is working for me to get the approval of people that are blindly following their crowd with little to no independent thought about the real complexity of addiction or how everyone s experience in recovery is different I m frustrated and I feel a little betrayed by these individuals who I had grown to consider friends Has anyone else experienced issues in their own recovery related to conflicting ideology with AA Or perhaps anyone else who has successfully used medical marijuana in recovery , months sober from alcohol benzodiazepenes with a couple program related caveats long post ,1

579,Don t get me wrong I love AA I just simply can t make it to a meeting every day My new sponsor and her sponsor have been on my ass about not making enough meetings The thing is I m a full time student and I work jobs plus an internship Before the semester started I had a lot more time for meetings During the week now I simply don t have time to get to a meeting every single day They tell me to prioritize AA What about my physical and mental health Personally I am so busy that I don t even have time to think about a drink I have hour days when school is in session By the time I get home I want to eat dinner shower relax and be in bed asleep by or pm Sometimes I feel like an hour at the gym is better for my well being than an hour at AA I also call my sponsor every day and keep in contact with other alcoholics daily I write the daily reflections in my journal every day and write on it I m staying sober in my right mind working my own version of the program And trust me when I am available I m at meetings every weekend I even chair a meeting every Saturday and I have another service position It just frustrates me when people assume things about me or my story and think that just because I can t attend meetings every single day of the week that I m not living in the program ,I m a little frustrated,1

582,Hi all years alcohol free here Just got back from a data at a trendy restaurant Being hip and all water was served out of liquour bottles ex our table had a tequila bottle with water inside Even though I m sure this tequila bottle had been cleaned out it still made me nervous to drink water that had been in the same container as tequila I did just want to go with the flow and so drank water out of this tequila bottle The water tasted like water nothing funny about it etc But I am thinking about alcohol now probably just a placebo effect But I m wondering if I could have ingested any tequila or other alcohol from this TLDR IS it safe for recovering alcoholics to drink water out of tequila or vodka bottles that have been cleaned and refurbished as water containers Thanks ,Anxious about Drinking Water Out of Refurbished Tequila Bottle,1

588,Hello My father has been an alcoholic for about years He doesn t admit well he admitted once and walks away on anyone who wants to talk about it with him He refuses help Recently he said he didn t know why he did it drinking and that he was gonna stop Of course he wouldn t be able to do it by himself but he denied external help like AA or a psychiatrist and of course he started drinking again in less than a month Now I don t live with him In fact I live in another state but I m visiting and I m close to his house We were supposed to travel together but because he is drinking heavily again I called it off and told him about it But I still want to sit down and talk to him in person and be serious about this I ve scheduled and paid for a psychiatrist for him to go on Monday So this would be the talk I want to help you please admit you need help the psychiatrist it paid for But what is the best way to say this I don t know how to talk in way that is loving effective and serious having in mind that he is been an alcoholic for almost years What should be my approach How not to offend him or get him defensive In his shoes what would you like to hear from your daughter or anyone close to you that wants to help you Or if you re not a recovery recovered alcoholic have you ever helped anyone in this manner and what did work for you I really need this help Thank you very much ,What should I say to my alcoholic father ,1

596,As of today I haven t had a drink or a drug in years Last month was my th birthday I got sober in AA at Needless to say when I was a kid or a teenager I didn t expect that by the time I was I d have already been an alcoholic and in recovery But that s how things ended up working out It s been a relatively tough year for me I ve had a string of medical problems that while none of them super serious have been very annoying and made day to day life a hassle It all started with the realization and diagnosis that I had tinnitus and some minor hearing loss presumably from too much rock and roll I never expected it to happen to me but it did protect your ears Luckily it s not too bad but it was hard to come to terms with it Some days I still struggle In the last few years since getting sober I took a liking to being fit and active Unfortunately I pushed things a little too hard and about months ago I developed a pain in my foot that basically kept me off my feet for whole months I decided to try swimming and due to improper technique I injured my back too I was really angry It s like I couldn t get a good streak going But what they taught me in AA was life s terms not mine My foot has healed My back has healed I still have tinnitus but I ve come to terms with it You know what would have happened back when I was drinking I would have self destructed Nowadays it s completely different for me I remember someone shared this at an AA meeting once now I have problems but I just walk through them That s what I did One day at a time Despite the annoyance frustration and all the other crap Sometimes all you have to do is keep going I guess that s why they say keep coming back Writing it all out now it all seems like pretty small stuff but in the moment it s horrific It brings up the question for me of what the hell is even the point of all this anyway if it s just going to be one thing after another That s what it brought up in me But I kept going And thanks to that not only did I remain sober but I also had the opportunity to do some really cool things I started reading a lot this year I took to writing more seriously I got more comfortable with myself and had an easier time doing what I wanted to do I didn t experience so much anxiety or depression I fell in love and enjoyed it I think that s the greatest gift of sobriety not only does it save us from self destruction it also gives us the opportunity to do something really cool with our lives It just takes a little patience sometimes If I had to draw any broad conclusion from these years it s that things do get better You have to be a little courageous that much is true But you don t have to be superhuman All you have to do is follow your heart and learn to trust If you can do that somehow things tend to work out It s OK to relax It s OK to be yourself It s OK to enjoy life Life is truly beautiful and I have sobriety and the foundation I learned in AA for giving me this second chance Best wishes to all , years today ,1
597,I m wrestling with a lot this morning No so much the urge to drink as anger and guilt over various things Some of it I deserve some I don t All of it is part of the process of my recovery and I m attempting to embrace it on those terms I spent part of yesterday reading the Big Book in particular the chapters about the Step Process It s both humbling and liberating This feels like the path towards letting go of what I ve been and done and finding a new way to live I want to thank you all for reading this and for the support you ve given ,Day Five,1

604,So I ve been with my gf for over years now and she has been very supportive of me getting help for my recently accepted alcoholism In the past months I ve been to a couple of rehabs and had days under my belt Friday However Friday I slipped and had a few drinks at her apartment that I visit on the weekends because I live in a half way house that only allows overnights on the weekends I ll provide better context So she works often times days a week at bars that close very late the one she works at majority of the time closes at am So since I ve been out of rehab and at this house the past several weekends Ive been picking up her apt keys while shes at work and go to her place to hang out enjoy not being around other guys in a home setting and enjoying her much more comfortable bed so we can spend sometime together when she gets off very late Now we ve had some strain in the past about her work life and how she can be not great at scheduling because often she ll sleep for plus hours then go start into work mood we agree she probably has a sleep disorder but that s another conversation So the constraints of the house rules during the week and limitations of the weekend make it so there is super limited time together as is so this was a win win dynamic So more on how the life style conflicts She mainly has only friends in the service industry and mainly spends non working hours of leisure at the bar s she works at or in a casual party setting aka alcohol around aplenty The past couple weekends if I wanted to see her before she crawled into bed after the next day s sunup I would hang out at the bar shes tending and its a dive so there is time for us to steal little interactions and moments together I was geniunely confident in my program to be able to hang out there but also had the ability to know when its getting too much and say Im going to leave Kind of The past three weekends I gently told her Im ready to go and she innocently did the sure thing Give me a few to say goodbye and everything but still a few hours would go by Or I would leave right when I wanted needed to and when she would get off work early enough to where we could have some quality time one on one at her place no innuendo intended she chose or got guilted into staying out going out with her bar friends Which bring me to Friday I walked into her room and theres a full glass of wine right next to her bed This isnt the first time something like that happened a couple weeks prior she had a plate with a small bit of cocaine left from hanging out with coworker friends She did have issues with coke in the past but it is now a couple times in the span of a months thing I ask every so often about it and she assures its not an issue and I trust so I take that as it So I drank that wine not cuz of her or the bad traffic or my depression kicking my ass that week I drank because I chose to drink All this focus on her choices and behavior none of that is a deflection I take fully ownership of my relaspe I do I told her what happened within mins of her getting home she yelled and called me a fucking asshole and said Im not allowed to hang out at her place like weve been doing anymore After we both cooled down I agreed that is probably a good call and I shouldnt be bar visiting anymore Like the wine glass being around it close enough to smell it was way too much for me I told my sponsor the next day I drank at like am on that friday so I told sponsor saturday But during the post confession talk she was crying saying she s scared our lives might not be capatable and she feels torn between me and bartending which she really does love And admittedly I have had a blinspot for her with asserting boundaries in the recent past In the spring which I in the end stages of denial of my alcoholism I told her I was having a bad week with drinking and was looking forward to an evening of quality time with her We go to a nice dinner and movie and after she wanted to keep the night going so she asked if we could go to a bar after the movie I said okay as long as its not gonna be too late which was true but she ended up getting semi sloppy drunk which is rare for her around me or not so much so that when we were fooling around later that night I had to use our safeword because she was biting and scratching too hard to the point where she popped a blood vessel in my lip from biting The other big and recent example was we went to her cousin s wedding over the summer and this was after my first go in rehab and real attempt at sobriety She asked if it was okay mutiple times for her to have only a couple drinks at the wedding which i really did think was fine Well throughout the weekend she made several comments and I see it in her demeanor she was craving time with family mainly her cousins that shes close with mutiple of them have been in each others wedding parties including my gf they just live all over the US Seeing them take shots and get dancy she asked if it was okay if she drank some more which I said was fine I was semi fine with it but on the plus drive over she without prompting from me said she wouldnt drink period on the trip so with some permission from the guidelines kept moving partially out of guilt from depriving her from a time with she was craving and or the fear that she would low key feel I deprived her of it So semi in conclusion I really do love this woman and she does me She has been a catalyst for me seeking self improvement before and after admitting my disease Friday evening did include a talk about how I havent put myself in smart situations but also reviewing how her our social life needs readjusting She cried and shes been feeling like shes been a bad partner There s also a recent thing about we she talked up so much about visiting me in rehab but overslept and missed the time window I assured her she is absolutely not and she has helped me tremendously throughout our relationship But there is strains We are SO dependent on her schedule in order to see each other Its always been like that in our relationship spending time together on her terms basically I explained to her Friday how cravings work and how scienctifically a craving can be as strong as the mental feeling of starving or being real thrist I ve asked her and she excitedly agreed months ago to go to Alano but still hasnt and now getting irked when i mention it since she is strapped for time But I think my fear over this leading to more conflict and to be super honest the downfall of our relationship culminated in me deciding to drink So TLDR I am in early recovery and trying to avoid alcohol while my gf s lifestyle actively is surrounded by it Also please advice on boundary assertion intricacies and relationship in recovery advice as well Pardon the wall of text but yeah appreciate any help or words of wisdom ,Advice on SO being a server as well as loves being a bartender lifestyle conflicts in

614, months Sober It s hard to explain where i m at On one side I have found the resilience to give up on something that once had it s claws all wrapped around my inner self It dictated how I felt and whispered lies of comfort Today I sit here wondering what did it take What has changed Why when I think of drugs or alcohol do I no longer feel intimidated or drawn by it Reading through my facebook posts from the last months I come to realise that a lot of it is due to me facing myself Yet lately I find myself ignoring a lot People I dearly miss and wish I had the courage to reach out to Things I desperately would want to have the courage to undertake All in all life has truly been a blessing I have met some wonderful people that have given me more to appreciate than just my own centre of a world Look within myself is still a daily task It s not a bad one though it s alleviating to remind myself that I am not the center of things Every day is a hill I climb in order to get closer and closer to my ultimate goal And even If I never reach the top I can find peace in knowing that i m trying every day to maintain active what keeps me sober I think back and as dark as things have been and sometimes still are I really feel liberated Truly find so much serenity in knowing that i m doing best and upholding standards I strive to live up to every day I have so much gratitude for the people in my lives Every single one them have brought me where I am today and I thank them for doing so Wether for better or worse I finally can say that i m confident about how I feel Will things get rough Possibly As long as I take it a day at a time and don t let my own head get the best of me I know i ll be fine It is in the acceptance of how things are that I can find serenity Finding peace and finding love is all that matters I embrace life fully and feel it all again Laughing like a child brings me back to a place of no sorrows Allowing myself to feel is what truly is beautiful about life Nothing compares to how determined I am to never go back to how things were It wasn t so much about not drinking and so much more about not wanting to Today I can say confidently that I want to be sober and embrace the feelings that come with it I no longer want to ignore and undermine myself My feelings matter to me and I am ok with them being around Thank you for taking the time to read , Months of Sobriety,1

623,I heard this when I first started coming and didn t believe it I thought if I could only get this alcohol thing under control all would be well Turns out even without the alcohol I am unhappy Im an asshole Im cynical Im self centered My nature is to hold on to grudges be angry and to be unapologetic Im a natural poor me kinda person So I started thinking maybe my thinking is my problem If I have busted thinking how would I know Would thinking about my thinking be enough to realize thinking is my problem If Im walking around with a broken compass how would I know its pointing the wrong way Even after I repeatedly end up in fucked up places I just keep following this compass because its all I have to guide me Then people with perfectly fine compasses like doctors psychiatrists judges family members try to tell me hey man YOU RE HEADING THE WRONG WAY and I just keep following this broken ass compass These people don t understand and haven t had the shitty life I ve had Why listen to them Then I met other people in AA with broken compasses too Its like a group of people said hey we think our compass is busted too We keep following it thinking we re doing good but then we end up in fucked up places again But there is this book and these steps that are like a map You can put down that busted ass compass and follow this instead Enough of us with severely broken compasses have made it out by following these Give it a try These people understand and have had a similar life I can listen to these people Im SO grateful for this program for showing me the way Ive had a profound change of thinking I thought life was all wrong and unfair I was actually living life wrong No wonder it was so bad Thanks for reading my rambles ,Alcohol is only a symptom of my problem ,1

625,My biggest character defect is laziness It s so difficult to do simple tasks at home like the dishes and laundry and I procrastinate so bad because of it It s starting to effect me financially because I m too lazy to make instant oatmeal for breakfast and pack a lunch for work so I m spending on eating out and creating unnecessary stresses It s effecting my step work too because I m just too lazy to pick up a pencil to jot a few sentences down or read for a couple minutes I end up procrastinating on that too and I don t feel like it s very thorough or heart felt I know some of has to do with a little fear too and possibly my will Like I d rather do what I want to do instead what I need to do Anybody have any experience strength and hope for me ,Anyone struggle with laziness ,1
626,I ve been hiding it I m an functional alcoholic I can work and do what I m told But I m not happy I ve pancreatitis from it I keep telling everyone I m just sick I do try to quit and I get sick The thing about alcohol You lie no matter what So many nights I pray for sleep and not to wake up I missed so much work bc of this I just like drinking ,I m an alcoholic ,1
627,I don t miss being drinking but I do miss spontaneity My program feels rigid right now meetings gratitude lists prayer meditation every day except Shabbat Routine routine routine I ve tried going to different meetings and talking to different people everything is slowing down big time after I ve finished my steps I look towards daoist principles in paying attention to the background and the spontaneous What do you do in sobriety to maintain your spontaneity ,What do you do for spontaneity ,1

632,I recently discovered that a girl I met on Tinder is an alcoholic She s been sexually abused as a child by her father found out days ago lost a child years ago and has been through multiple traumatic events throughout her life that s caused her to become suicidal She started drinking after her month miscarriage Her child was her reason to start living a productive and healthy life then she lost her baby She has no will to live anymore and I m incredibly worried about her wellbeing desire to kill herself We ve known each other for months and we met on Tinder We ve basically just been fwb and I have no desire to pursue sex anymore so I deleted Tinder all other dating apps and was going to tell her I m not interested in casual sex anymore However the past couple days she opened up about how she s feeling and her past I only learned about her alcoholism yesterday as she now has to go to the hospital for detox I don t know what to do Taking care of her emotionally is affecting my schooling and my goals but I m scared to just leave abruptly due to her suicidal thoughts and alcoholism I know she s going to relapse due to the grief of losing her kid I can t let my life be affected by a girl I ve only known for months and was just a long term hookup but I also won t drop someone in their worst condition Any and all help would be appreciated thank you , Girlfriend has been to the hospital multiple times due to drinking Considering not being w her anymore ,1
633,First time I drank was it was during quarantine when covid first began Now I m at first it was just for fun Never drank prior to that but I felt cool for drinking I remember clanking bottles in the house to show my siblings I was drinking showing my friends but now I m embarrassed It still is fun but I wish I didn t need it to be fun Now I feel like as if I need it to be myself I can t relax without it and I don t want to imagine my future relationship to alcohol Every time I go to work I drink every time I go to school I drink if I wanna hangout with someone I drink I ran out of alcohol though stole all my parents from their diy bar and my friend hookup crashed their car so now I don t have a hookup Although I ve thought of lying to my brother and have him get some for me and realistically I will My parents still have a bit left my father actually found a couple bottles in my room a little while back I told him I drank them while I was with a couple friends He dismissed it but I told him I d pay him back which is no problem at all but I want more Idk if I want more or need more at this point but I get annoyed very easily if I drink so little I ll drink a few beers and that s not enough for me I don t get buzzed like I would originally so I ll get upset I realize I m half decently drunk then think well this feeling will only last a little while then I ll need more then I ll get sad about it I drank a bottle of wine today along with a couple other things blacked out in the middle of class today I woke up at the end stumbling across the street I wish I didn t need it but it makes my day so much better when I drink I wish there was a substitute for it And I don t know what I can do about it ,Idk man I feel like I need alcohol to be happy and keep a personality ,1

636,Can t even stomach any food and sooooo nausious,Worst hangover ever today Thinking it will be the last ,1
637,On February th of this year I was arrested for a th offense OWI My previous were years ago I spent and terrifying days in jail I was blacked out when the arrest happened so I really didn t know what had happened until I got out I started going to meetings the day after I got out of jail Really threw myself into the program got a sponsor worked the steps and things slowly started getting better I even made some friends including a man with years of Sobriety that I became fairly close with He ended up wanting to be more than friends I told him I wasn t really interested in him like that but he was really really persistent and to be honest it felt really nice to have someone pay so much attention to me He was always there if I needed something and checked in on me But he also had a tendency to gossip about other people in the program telling me who was actually sober who smoked pot or did other drugs and it got in my head The day after my month mark I said fuck it and got drunk for days Came back first stepped Made it weeks and I hung out with the guy again Found out that in reality he didn t have the years he claimed and that he d drank periodically over the past year or so And we got drunk together for like a week straight He went to detox and I went back to my meetings again I told him we couldn t hang out any more But he didn t really like that and started pursuing me more intently I relapsed again one night and I was really down on myself about it and didn t know who to turn to I d stopped communicating with my sponsor by that time and I just struggled to find the courage to reach out to anyone else But he reached out to me and the morning after he came over to help He gave me one of his oxys I don t even like opiates And then he left to go get us lunch He came back with a bunch of alcohol and we got hammered The next day I told him that I absolutely couldn t hang out with him or even talk to him anymore and to stay away from me But I haven t stopped drinking since That was weeks ago I ve been completely isolating myself embarrassed and drunk and feeling like a piece of shit I m scared to go back to my meetings because I don t want to risk running into him again and because I m ashamed and embarrassed by my weakness I m really going to try not to drink today and hopefully find a new meeting where he won t be tomorrow But I m still just so embarrassed I felt like I was doing so well and everything just came crashing down around me I m tired of feeling worthless and stupid and scared of everything I don t want to bring this story up at the meetings here because the AA world is small in my town and there s a high probability someone would know who I m talking about and I m not trying to throw him under the bus I know he s sick too and it s not his fault I drank because I wanted to drink not because of anything he did but at the same time it s not a good situation How do I pluck up the courage to walk back in and admit my failure and start over Ugh This whole thing just sucks Sorry this was really long I just needed to vent all that out Thanks for reading ,Struggling to return after relapse,1

641,It s three years to the day since my last drink I barely remember it like it was yesterday On my last night of drinking I promised not to get drunk then drank alone in a garage through the entirety of a child s birthday party drove my family home drunk and faded to black I was sitting in my first AA meeting less than hours later AA saved my life I don t care if it s a trope I am alive today because the people in those rooms took me in showed me the way and I was beat down enough to listen There are so many close calls drunk accidents fights health and legal issues and insane decisions I really don t know how I survived long enough to even make it to the rooms but I know I wouldn t have made it much longer I m posting today to share my hope I used to think I was a mid bottom drunk because I never killed anyone or went to jail I later heard from others I was probably a low bottom drunk based on my story Eventually I realized it didn t matter I was just a drunk The important part is the recovery and I am through the power of something greater than myself recovered Not recover ING Recover ED As the book says I have recovered from a hopeless condition of mind and body through the Steps Since entering the program the promises in the book have been fulfilled in my life I have a peace I ve never had I have patience I love deeper I can experience being loved I can provide and be of service My marriage was saved I lost pounds our sex is x better I make triple what I did when I was drinking I paid off all my taxes lawsuits legal fees and maxed out credit cards I am a father to my kid like an actually present one involved in her world I ve dealt with mental health issues previously hidden by self medication with drugs and alcohol You literally would not recognize me whether looking at me or my actions I still have problems character defects and struggle It s not perfect and it never will be But it doesn t have to be and I know no substance or destructive behavior is going to fill that hole The longing I felt will sometimes return and when it does there is a solution the Steps If you re new if you re suffering if you don t know what is going to get you out of the hell you are in I suggest you give them a real shot Taken as prescribed with rigorous honesty they really do work Essentially they re a catalyst to spiritual experience or limit experience some might say A way to induce a radical change in the way you view the world around you and really a change in yourself They work If you ve got less time than me I hope reading this inspires you You should know reading your experiences and struggles on this sub inspires me bringing the brutal truth of alcoholism freshly into my memory It has a habit of fading You keep me motivated I m grateful to have talked with a lot of people from this sub and hopefully helped There is a way out and you are on the right path If you ve got more time than me I m inspired by your strength and experience Thank you for being here and passing hope and knowledge on to us youngins I am just overwhelmingly grateful to the program the community and my higher power In the immortal words of the great Ye he s done miracles on me , years without a drink,1

645,I m a teenager and for as long as I can remember my dad has been drinking It s not like he gets mad at us or hurts us when he s drunk quite the opposite actually Lately we don t talk that much because whenever I see him drunk or slurring his words I have the urge to leave and be alone It hurts to see him like that My dad is getting older and older but he seems to have no plans of stopping Ive already asked him to stop or lessen his drinks a few times but it never ends up happening I love my dad with all my heart which is why I hate it so much when I see him in that state How do I get him to stop He s very stubborn and hard to talk to when it comes to these things He says that he knows what he s doing and he takes vitamins but I know just by the empty bottles in the kitchen that his drinking needs to stop and is not healthy I don t want to pressure him nor hurt him but I along with the rest of my family is really worried about him How can I best approach this situation lt ,How do I get my dad to stop drinking ,1

656,I really feel like social anxiety drives me to alcohol Anyone self medicate for the same reason How do I get out of this loop I am worried if I am prescribed meds then I would have to detox but the detox is what scares me because I drink beers a night Because of my job I can t go to rehab I am so done with this I feel like I am living in a gray world right now No feelings working my ass off and just living for the evenings when I can relax and have a beverage My husband is a drinker but NOT to my level He takes care of so much I suck I hate this ,Social Anxiety,1

659,I m struggling a lot with my sobriety I feel so weak and powerless over this substance I made it months from mid June early January Relapsed drank myself silly for a month and ended up in treatment in February April I ve been sober since February so I ve now made it months sober almost However now I m feeling that compulsion to drink again My partner supports my sobriety but I came to the realization I m still uncomfortable even seeing him drinking in front of me when we go out Almost all of my support system still drinks in front of me and I just realized I hate it It s a stupid thing to be upset about I know and I can t tell if this is a normal reaction or if I m simply being a diva I even got invited to a birthday party but it was at a bar I declined and said I didn t trust myself but wished them the best day I started a new job ironically in a treatment center and we take the clients to AA every Saturday I don t participate but I suddenly feel the calling to attend one of my own My only worry is if I ll find someone willing to sponsor me I have massive imposter syndrome as I work in treatment and ask my clients How are your cravings every day When I ask myself this question I m still at a I long for the day I am comfortable and happy in my sobriety Someone please tell me it gets easier you feel happier and the cravings stop gnawing at you It doesn t help that society is literally obsessed with alcohol I can t watch a show without seeing a commercial for booze I want to feel free And I hope that AA is the first step to feeling freedom and peace ,I feel weak today and I think it s time to join AA ,1

661,My childhood wasn t great I was forced by my mother to be her personal therapist she always dumped all her shit on me and blamed me for not handling it perfectly I was sexually abused by multiple people growing up and both my parents were violent throwing things around and punching holes in walls I turned to alcohol at and was an alcoholic until when what I m about to describe happened Due to my abuse I was weird at school I confided in people too quickly I couldn t keep my hands to myself etc I didn t know how to make friends But one boy also at the time in particular gave me the time of day He was kind to me which was something that I was missing in my life We began dating but I was toxic He cut me off and I thought that if I really loved him I couldn t let him out of my grasp I began stalking him and harassing him I followed him home from school would try to talk to him I created multiple social media accounts to message him to the point of him having to delete his social media s etc But one night I got really drunk and the amazing idea of breaking into his house came to me I went to his house and entered through an open window which led to his little sister s bedroom In a drunken rage I began yelling at her and he and his parents rushed into the room to try and get me out They ended up calling the police and I was arrested there was a trial and I ended up going to jail for a year Since then I ve been in therapy and have been required to do a step program I m on the step of making amends and that brought this back up in my mind I m certain that I traumatized that family especially the little girl do you think they would want to receive an apologetic letter from me TLDR I had a boyfriend who I stalked harassed and eventually broke into his house and got arrested Should I apologize ,Should I F write to the family whose house I broke into as a part of my making amends step steps program ,1

664,Hi I m a year old and I feel like I might be developing a problem I ve had previous encounters with many substances and despite struggling with very addictive ones benzos I managed to give them up all on my own and have never looked back Here in Australia alcohol is the only accepted drug and weed and all other substances are frowned upon which is completely fine but as they say Everyone has their poison and very early on or so mine was alcohol I was hospitalized I ve woken up hours away from my home I ve ran face first into a fish tank I ve never done anything malignant or harmful to other ppl beyond when I drove drunk and nearly drove off a cliff a few years back Despite mostly ending my own life If the story was written different I could have harmed someone else I ve tried to end my life and resorted to self harm a lot because of the way I am when I m sober I honestly believe I m in control despite knowing the impacts it s having on my work life mental health family and it ruined a great relationship years back The saddest part is part of me honestly believes I m still winning and in control when I give it time It s like I recycle shit emotions for new ones each time I might stop for a day or two and say never again but I m right back at it once the guilt takes it s course We have a massive drinking culture here in Aus and a lot of my friends are bonded over a beer so in regards of feeling lonely it s difficult I m also quite shy and find a few drinks let me have a good time But I can t stop and often prefer drinking alone so despite seeing friends I ll end up going home and continuing the drinking alone I moved from spirits to beer which was a massive help I could limit myself at least and keep track But it became a heavy hitter on the bank and also despite never being over weight I started to notice a beer gut But I find myself stuck in this loop of what I have is not enough and I wake up depressed and anxious about my decisions and actions the previous night although most are not terrible or destructive mostly talking to friends a bit to lively than usual or staying up too late I draw the line at not being able to wake up for work and messaging ppl at stupid hours when most ppl have a life and aren t up all night It s embarrassing I have gotten far better at controlling that which also worries me I use to work at a liquor store and I finally got a new job which I hoped would set me straight and it did but I ve found myself stuck in this same loop of If I only buy beers it ll be fine and end up sourcing alcohol elsewhere after I ve obviously tried not drinking but alcohol is all over my house I could walk blindfolded and run into a long island iced tea I guess I m scared that once I stop that is it I can t ever drink again I loose my social life I get bored of hanging out with the people I grew up with despite majority of them being far more interesting than I am and I end up just living a life more or less dedicated to fuck all It s also very family oriented I have to learn to talk to my own family without drinking and watching them drink This is very genetic alcoholism runs in my family I m aware I need to stop to be honest its just really shit that I have to And honestly scary I appreciate it s short sighted but it s hard to see new doors opening when you re so focused on the ones you wish you didn t have to close I don t expect ppl to have all the answers but I m very curious based off what I ve told you would you please enlighten me on what might help profession help or what helped you ,Do I need Help ,1

671,Sobriety has changed my life in so many ways despite it only being the very beginning of my journey But this makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside the way I used to claim alcohol made me feel except this is a real feeling My fianc is finally warming up to me again My rock bottom wasn t when I was hospitalized multiple times for alcohol poisoning fired from my job woke up in strange places injured my neck or broke a rib What truly hit me and made me want to do this was my fianc being one and a half feet out the door Something about the thought of losing him made me take a long hard look at myself and something in my brain ticked and told me I HAVE to do this I NEED change For the sake of my life my health my future my sanity and my family I started putting in the work attending meetings sometimes a day and building a foundation to get and stay sober One day one moment at a time He started holding my hand and saying I love you first again He came on to me first for the first time in over a year I can t blame him since being drinks deep slurring and stumbling isn t exactly a turn on Nor was being depressed from booze or hungover I was horrible to him I was never mean or violent but him seeing me a drunken mess definitely took it s toll Him seeing me taken away in an ambulance or having to pick me up from a hospital cause I passed out drunk in public Him coming home to seeing me passed out in the shower or after raiding the fridge I was horrible to myself I d lie about how much I consumed and put alcohol before his feelings despite him always telling me and me knowing yet denying that it was a BIG problem Nobody deserves to see their significant other in such a state I m truly blessed to have another chance To be able to love myself and him right To be able to show myself and him that I truly can change Oppose to making empty promises about next time like I used to Promising that it ll never happen again until it did cause I didn t take sobriety seriously or put in any effort whatsoever But this time is and will be different Yesterday we spent the entire day together We cuddled held hands played video games went to the movies laughed and enjoyed our time together To truly be there for him for us Felt amazing To live and appreciate every moment Even just running errands with him Unlike when I was a drunk and didn t know how to appreciate the simple things in life Now every moment is a blessing To have my best friend back I can t even begin to explain how happy I feel The work must continue I won t stop now just cause I m finally getting the love of my life back This is only the beginning But seeing how rewarding sobriety can be has truly given me a new perspective on life It gives me the drive to keep going To keep doing better I m blessed and I will not drink today ,Feel like I m starting to get my life back and it s beautiful,1

691,Just today I realised that I m a huge piece of shit I used to think I was a good person with a problem that needed fixing but I realised that when it came down to it I was just a good person when it s easy to be but I realised that for the last few years whenever I had to make a decision between the right choice or the selfish choice to get fucked up on drugs alcohol sex ignoring my responsibilities and the well bring of those around me I always chose the selfish option because it made me feel good happy for awhile without caring for the consequences to make myself feel better just because I had a fucked up life with long lasting trauma that doesn t mean I have any right to potentially fuck up someone else s to make myself feel better for a few hours These last few years have possibly been the worst years of my life so bad that I tried to commit suicide by overdosing a few months ago I never intended to hurt people intentionally I would never want to hurt the ones I love and innocent people but I have destroyed good meaningful relationships and hurt friends and loved ones and I ve even put people into dangerous positions where someone could ve been seriously injured or even killed Everytime I would blackout I always used to think these were mistakes and that I was just a danger to myself but I realise now they weren t mistakes at all and that my self destructive choices have harmed other people I chose to do this shit over and over and over again even when I knew what could happen and that once I start drinking I can not stop Something deep inside me wants to self destruct I have been battling alcohol abuse since I was a teenager but no one controlled me or forced me I gladly and willingly chose the fun option to make myself feel better by self medicating over the right one even when I knew the potential consequences but this time I can control myself I would tell myself I m so lucky I have never seriously harmed or injured someone else and that the only consequence is that some people hate me and avoid me even after I have apologised and even though they ve accepted and pretend it s okay now but I can feel it whenever I happen to see them and I deserve it I can live with people hating me for being a fucking mess but I would never be able to forgive or live with myself if I seriously harmed anyone or caused someone s death that wasn t my own The reason why I realised these things about myself is because I have very slowly managed to pull myself out of the hole I was trying to get out of for the past years I ve been going to therapy and I ve had about different therapists different rehabs and psychologists trying to fix myself but fuck me it was a hard and terrible road for everyone and I can finally see things clearly without the cloud of self loathing and hatred obscuring my vision I haven t blacked out in months and it s been almost a year since I ve had a major incident and that s because I met a wonderful girl she s honestly one of the best and most pure person I ve ever met thinking of doing something that would hurt her finally knocked some sense into me everytime I think I might potentially hurt her feels like a punch in my gut She doesn t deserve it and honestly I don t even deserve her she s too good for me and with the help of my family who never abandoned me and has always supported me especially my poor father I must ve aged him by an extra years I haven t eaten or slept in days because the full consequences and scope of my actions have finally dawned on me after I returned from one of the best weekends of my life with my girl without using drugs or alcohol which is the first time in my life that I ve had that much fun sober or fucked up I admit it I m an asshole I m a self centered self hating piece of fucking shit and I couldn t even see it until now But that all changes today This realisation is very hard to process and it s really hard to not hate myself for everything I ve done even with all the progress I ve made since To those who I dont remember or who I never got the chance to apologise to I m so fucking sorry,I just realised I m a huge piece of shit but that stops today ,1
692,I am struggling with AA in the COVID era The meetings I go to used to get lots of newcomers now very few trickle in The meetings are now turning into the same people saying the same thing to each other It is frustrating and burning me out I am trying to find a new meetings in nearby towns but I am so busy that it is hard to get to them Thanks for listening I just had to get this of my chest ,AA Burnout,1

694, Since Ive been at university Ive used alcohol to get to sleep which I think in lots of respects contributed to my psychotic episode last year Since then my use of alcohol has spiralled to a point where this weekend I had a bit of a breakdown and ended up in hospital after attempting to unlive The doctors have said the best method for treatment is at home as Im not having any delusions just a few auditory hallucinations ive always been quite depressed so ive been feeling a bit hopeless about that ever changing I was wondering if anyone could give some advice on how to continue without A being intoxicated B without the grand ideals which came with psychosis I think have this really stupid god complex where i can only be content when life is extraordinary e g becoming a rockstar that makes people love eachother more or an amazing relationship or starting a revolution to dismantle capitalism which in turn causes a much needed change in western culture I know those examples are delusional but they aren t delusions they are just desires as I don t believe any of those things would ever come true I actually really liked being psychotic cause I at least believed they would come true which brought me a lot of content I think thats why I wanted to commit Cause i dont want to keep working my ass off to feel no joy whatsoever There is no meaning in working the to for the rest of my life to make someone else rich when all i get back is social anxiety depression and some money to pay for bills and booze I want to conclude by saying im not suicidal now i want to get better but i could use some help in finding out what kind of life i could live and how to deal with these frustrations ,Problems with alcohol and living this life,1
695,I knew dating within the rooms or getting involved in any entanglements with someone you see regularly in meetings was probably a bad idea but I did it anyway Needless to say it crashed and burned pretty horribly and now I often run into this person at my home group meetings three meetings a week that I go to regularly It s very awkward seeing him and sometimes downright painful but I refuse to stop going to the meetings that got me sober I tried for about two weeks to go to other meetings but I just didn t like them and didn t feel like I connected or related to anyone The person I was with has been going to the meetings for many years but I just refuse to let this person push me away from my sober support network For added context I do have a sponsor and I am working the steps I have not gotten to step yet I currently have months of sobriety I realize getting involved in a relationship in early recovery was a bad idea and I have already beaten myself up about it enough so need to drive the point home anymore Has anyone else stayed in meetings after a break up How did you cope and maneuver around that person ,I refuse to stop going to my home group meetings,1

700,A week ago I relapsed after a half a year of sobriety under my belt Throughout this time I began to find structure in my life an inner peace began to develop and a stability I d never encountered before while drinking Passion for hobbies began to resurface The feeling I chased in a bottle became the promise granted with sobriety Heaven on earth wouldn t be the way to describe sobriety but even though the days felt longer and the temptation remained it was worth it one hundred percent When I relapsed drinking felt different I found that in comparison to the joy I found in daily life sober the joy I found in strengthening relationships and putting my all into my work being drunk just felt tiring The feeling alcohol gave me felt synthetic dulling my emotions and range of expression Not to mention that afterwards I had nothing to show for it apart from an aching body and a looming cloud of depression I m back on the bandwagon thankfully going to meetings and taking it one day at a time Though I will say this relapse was a huge reminder and positive affirmation of why alcohol will be the devil I choose not to dance with It pales in comparison to choosing life ,It s not the same anymore,1

703, Hi everyone So I met a very sweet woman at AA a few days ago She s been super helpful with bringing me to meetings introducing me to people and encouraging me but I feel like she s also using me to vent and unload She started gossiping about others who attend the same meetings as us She talks a million words per minute and it really makes my anxiety go through the roof and I feel like it s really damaging to my sobriety It s literally the entire ride to and from meets Not a second less I really love that she s kind and wants to help me That she sees me as a person she can trust and open up to But I feel like it s just so she can complain to me and unload her problems past traumas I still have my things that I am trying my best to deal with sober and am only days into this I m scared that this may eventually lead to my demise I ve been trying so hard to practice mindfulness and stay positive And I ve been doing great otherwise People at the meetings tell me to stick with her And I m scared that if I tell her I can t go with her anymore or tell her why that she ll either just show up where I live start drama or spread rumors about me at the meets or who knows what else I don t want to be the one to potentially trigger a relapse either I don t want to hurt her feelings and I get she s also going out of her way to help me but my sobriety needs to come first for me And I m way too new to sobriety to be handling other people s traumas like this She s told me way too much about her in the last few days and I m still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me Is this selfish of me I know there s a step that says to help others and that the program only works if you help others but I feel like I need to help myself first Has anyone been in this situation before What should I do I don t want to offend or hurt anyone But I need to continue this path without my peace being broken Thank you for your time ,Friend in AA is nice but I Need Advice ,1

711,Hi all I m a year old woman and just had my first child in May I remained sober my entire pregnancy for my son s health but since giving birth I ve fallen right back into regular drinking I m a highly functional drunk I m capable of doing everything normally speaking normally and I never allow myself to breastfeed after more than the recommended limit of glasses of wine But once I breastfeed I down a few more drinks to make the most of that time before I have to sober up again I do not endanger my son for the most part we bottle feed him A few important notes I and my husband both were raised by alcoholic mothers I cared for my mother in my teenage years while she scream cried for hours and pulled knives on me slurred and stumbled etc My father gave up helping her they separated and I was her caretaker Then it was my baby brother when I left She considers herself well now And while she is happy and I enjoy being around her again she very much is still a heavy drinker I have attempted to quit before and I always manage to justify not continuing my streak Usually it s I ll only drink on the weekends or I ll drink as much water as alcohol I ll only drink the seven drinks max limit etc I am on heavy ish medication An anti anxiety an anti depressant and a beta blocker I ALWAYS end up hating myself in the midst of drinking Every Fucking Time I get so pissed that I let myself drink as much as I did Then once the headache goes away and I sleep it off I manage to justify it all over again the next night I saw a therapist for years and she repeatedly told me she did not believe I had a problem even though I regularly brought it up She thinks I only feel out of control because I m so scared to become my mother But I never want to put my son through what I went through I want to live a long healthy life Frankly I m terrified I ve somehow already fucked up my body I guess my question is this how do you start and HOW do you keep committed I can t seem to make quitting stick ,I may have a problem or the beginnings of one ,1

715,Not related but I sobered up years ago today I stayed sober for almost years I never got around to being fully independent in that time then I definitely wasn t independent after I relapsed I m sober months now I know I don t want want to drink or get high but I have no faith in my ability to work socialize healthily and stay focused on my goals enough to make healthy progress I m particularly triggered lately because I m thinking I need to rehome my dog Every time I have gone to rehab the hospital or left town to help dying family I have no one who can take proper care of him and I don t really know any services that are trustworthy I get confused frustrated scared and sad whenever I think about anything like getting a job having an apartment of my own or trying to keep the program first I get depressive and anxious meds take away most of my ability to enjoy my life and I just don t want to live in this shitty circumstance anymore I haven t attempted suicide in a long time which I guess is progress but I have relapsed a couple times trying to get back into the program because I can t think about anything other than not wanting to deal with life My AA home group are awesome I love them and they love me but when any pressure comes my way and I become anxious or depressive they are quick to point me towards therapy Therapy really doesn t seem to be helpful at all I can t help but think that I m just lying to myself about the success of the program I just feel like pretending I m alright having some small victories that make other people think I m better and ignoring everything I feel and think to just outsource my purpose is all I m doing Where is the happy joyous and free life I ve been promised How does it slip away so frequently I m just not grateful right now I try to be of service to get out of myself but ultimately I m not supporting myself I m get scared and confused when I think about what I need to do to be self sufficient This is just sad and pathetic ,I just want to give up ,1

724,My boyfriend m and I f have been in a serious relationship for almost years We began dating months before the pandemic which were super intense and tumultuous because of loosing roommates and jobs So he moved in to help me and we were pretty inseparable Everything was great with us until I started noticing he lacked control with alcohol I didn t say anything at first but it became daily during the pandemic that I had to check myself because I was gaining weight from it He has gotten so drunk that he has peed on the couch and our bed while passed out Those were the biggest red flags and it was unbelievable at first He has gotten into the habit of drinking so much when he goes back to his hometown about miles away with his friend that he doesn t come back until the next day I hate this so much and I told him I couldn t take it so we discussed taking a break two weeks ago It was very emotional and he refuses to admit there is a problem I started asking him to consider aa or therapy He mentioned him and his friend going to AA ONCE and now denies that it is for him He thinks I am trying to control him Last night was his birthday and he was suppose to meet me after my class and go to dinner together But he got too drunk and stayed where he was He bailed on our plans I don t know what to do or say anymore because it appears he will only understand us breaking up and me leaving him ,Am I just controlling ,1
725, Hi everyone I wanted to create this account and join this community to connect with others on the same journey as myself Sorry that it s kind of long I ve been struggling with alcohol addiction for the better part of years I m now It originally started as a way to cope with being bullied in school body shaming childhood trauma physical mental abuse at home and from a teacher rape being taken by DCYF due to skipping school and just never quite fitting in no matter how hard I tried I always felt like there was something wrong with me I ended up staying back in school for two years and dropped out in the th grade as soon as I turned I kept most of these issues bottled up and picked up smoking cigarettes self harm drinking and smoking pot with my few friends who were also outcasts I finally felt like I belonged since we all did the same thing to numb the pain When I turned I got a fake ID and started dancing to make enough to move out of my abusive home I got my own place and thought I was queen of the world Well unfortunately that job just glorified drinking and drugging and sent me down an even worse path I stopped self harm and smoking pot cigarette but the drinking got much worse as it was just handed to me I d pound down shots and put myself in risky situations But the money was incredible and since all my peers were doing it and my employer encouraged it I felt like I belonged I knew it was getting into a problem when even they fired me for getting too drunk I lost friends who were party people themselves Cause I just couldn t hold my liquor cause I was all or nothing Having an eating disorder while drinking probably didn t help Anyways this went on for years I traveled to get away and any time anyone called me out on being a sloppy drunk I got defensive and figured they were the problem I felt like the whole world was against me That they were the problem When in reality if you think everyone around you has a problem you re more than likely THE problem yourself The only people I clicked with were those who would enable me and laugh when I got drunk but still hang out again The ones who wouldn t judge me and would feed my addiction I got so bad that I d go out on dates just so someone could buy me drinks and get me drunk Even if I just Irish goodbyed them after I ve been hospitalized many times from passing out at bars or in public But I wouldn t say it was cause I got drunk I d insist that I didn t drink that much and that somebody must ve drugged my drink I lied despite knowing the truth even when I was pronounced dead for seconds Nothing stopped me I thought I was so sly hiding bottles burying cans under the trash so it would look like I drank less Thinking I was holding my composure when I was a drunken mess After all of this I still never thought my problem was a problem Last year I attended my first AA meeting But I compared instead of identified I didn t take it seriously and despite staying sober for months as soon as my bday came around I thought I was cured and that I can just have one or two and be fine What a joke that was Sure the first few times I was able to but then I was like well if I can have two then I can probably have and be fine too Ha It got worse and worse I denied having a problem cause it wasn t daily I d just binge about twice per week My poor fianc would come home from work and see me a drunken mess But something hit me and hit me hard like a ton of bricks about a week ago If I don t get help I m going to die alone He s going to leave me I ll be stuck in this toxic cycle And I cried for days thinking about it Almost got suicidal But then something told me I can t give up I can t lose faith That I am a great person when I don t abuse alcohol That I need help That is when I swore on everything that I WILL not just try quit I want to feel alive and have a purpose I want a bright future To have a family A happy home Instead of building a life like the one I grew up with and around I deserve better My family deserves better even if they tried to enable me and my fianc deserves better I ve been attending zoom meets daily as well as in person meets I met a friend at AA who takes me to live meetings daily and is as eager about sobriety and helps encourage me I try to speak at every meeting to get over the mental block and thought that I NEED alcohol for people to accept me and to talk to others I got two chips that I carry everywhere as a reminder I quit my bar tending job to avoid sabotage keep a journal that I write in twice per day I keep positive messages around the house meditate and have been practicing mindfulness I even went out with a group of people from AA to dinner yesterday For the first time the voice in the back of my head that tells me to drink was nowhere to be found It was amazing To be able to smile laugh talk freely and be myself without using alcohol as a crutch like I did for years I know it s just the beginning but I feel blessed I feel like I m on a path to finally break free from everything I once knew I ll finally be able to grow and create a beautiful life If you made it this far thank you for taking the time to read my story Sharing this so openly was tough but I feel relieved and maybe my story will help someone else Recovery is possible Whether you are on day or year you got this and are doing amazing Thank you ,I m Kay and I m an alcoholic This is my story possible TW ,1

729,Flew to across the country to make amends to my ex wife In the years we were together I took everything I could from her to gratify myself and make me feel better about myself No matter how much she gave I wanted more I took until she had barely anything left to give and that s when I really turned up the pressure to squeeze more out and when she was finally totally empty I abandoned her went and took some from my neighbor My selfishness was bottomless Thank God for AA The amends is an opportunity for us to give to those from whom we have taken for their sake We come to this program powerless meaning we had been relying on the delusion of personal power that we don t really have No matter how hard we tried to exert personal power to manage our lives we always ended up in the same place desperate and drunk with a path of wreckage behind us When we work this program of recovery with diligence we get connected or reconnected to a higher power that fills us up and guides us if we let it I am very grateful that my higher power gave me words of truth to speak and filled me with love compassion understanding and most importantly faith all of which I was able to give to my ex wife without the expectation of getting anything in return That is a miracle It works if you work it ,Last amends complete ,1

731,Going on years of being an alcoholic now I don t drink EVERY day but the days I don t drink I spend sitting in bed shaking and begging people to buy me something anything Last night it hit the roof My grandma and aunt have been giving me a place to live under the pretense of I do not drink I ve drank a lot since moving here and last night it was very obvious I ve had pancreatitis twice in the past two years and the first time almost killed me yet I still can t seem to stop the want to drink I need help ,Made my grandmother cry last night,1
732,Asking for a friend Friend m has been drinking not at alcoholic levels since he was about He was going through some personal things and spent the last months drinking heavily and likely is an alcoholic Drinking at am until he passed out waking up and drinking some more and never skipping a day Mostly vodka Between and pints per day on single drinking days and about double that on days he would drink sleep then drink some more He was hiding it from his wife or so he thought and she finally confronted him a couple weeks ago He knew she was right about him likely being an alcoholic and he knew she was right about how it was affecting their relationship his work etc so he quit cold turkey that day It s been two weeks But here s the thing he feels fine In fact he feels pretty damn great If he went through withdrawals they were minimal and short lived And he doesn t even crave it He s around other people drinking and will even cook with beer and wine still I am certain he has not relapsed and hidden it trust me and I believe he feels the way he says he feels So if he could go from drinking the amount he did to not drinking at all overnight and without withdrawals or even cravings do you think he s really an alcoholic or could he maybe have just settled into a shitty routine for the last year and simply needed to be snapped out of it Also as I said he feels great He gained a lot of weight over the last year and was basically either drunk or hungover all the time He has complained of stomach abdomen discomfort and of feeling generally bad in the past but he barely ate barely slept and drank liquor every day so feeling like ass with stomach pains doesn t sound too unusual but he was a little concerned he may have done serious damage to his internal organs Two weeks later though and all the pain is gone and his appetite is back and he basically seems to be like he was months ago only about lbs heavier Do you think he could have internal organ damage He doesn t like going to the doctor Thanks TLDR friend seemed to be a bad alcoholic for the last months and then quit cold turkey He seems completely fine No withdrawal cravings and he feels great Is he an alcoholic and might he still have internal organs damage ,Is my friend an alcoholic and are his organs likely okay ,1

734,mostly rambling but im still connecting things my brother moved in with my wife and i when we got out of his second visit to rehab he is and very smart shy but funny when we is in a good mood it was really good until it wasnt i guess the freedom that our house allowed with us all working let him slip up this wasnt a huge deal at first we got home from work and realized what had happened we were not tooooo suprised but sad we took his alcohol i took the next day off of work so we could talk about things and set some more defined boundaries we chatted but wanted to wait until my wife got home i took what stuff i could find from his room and we went back to bed to rest from the day before I was in the house and he continued to drink i guess he snuck out while i slept or something i was just one room over and he wasnt able to step out and say anything this is tearing me up i know shame must be rooted to his core believing he is disappointing us and now i feel like it is my fault for trusting him in his room alone my wife is throwing some shade he is back in rehab thank god but i am scared for him if one of his only friends is just one room over and is unable to do anything how will he ever get out of this it is getting so bad im scared that if he cannot reach out to me or anyone he will end up drinking himself to death my parents told me some stories about how bad it can get for him and i feel like this is how it is going to end they tried setting hard boundaries but he ends up sneaking out and drinking during the night or driving around or just running away amp x B any insight into him or how i can live with myself could be great ,scared for my brother scared for myself,1

736,I am going downhill After a night of binge drinking with a coworker the next day I felt very odd And almost a full hours later I passed out because a streak of back pain hit me right in the spine I m concerned for two reasons one is because I can t tell if this is a flu or alcohol Two is that I m having to even ask this question Also I know I m on probation for a dui and I m still drinking every other weekend Almost like how my ex used to And I saw him get to the point where we had to divorce Based on everyone s experience do you know these to be symptoms of binge drinking On google it gives me results of passing out while drinking ,How do I stop ,1
737,I went to detox for the first time weeks ago and I wrote this reflection today I didn t expect things to magically turn around and to be singing coombia but I haven t really felt any good changes yet I didn t know where else to post this and if I am alone feeling this way When you stop drinking People close to you will say things like I am proud of you it takes courage and strength to admit you have a problem and to do something about it we re still friends we ll still invite you to stuff and we ll figure out stuff to do you ll feel better soon it gets better no shame in getting help It feels like bullshit You feel alone you feel left out You feel like everyone you know now treats you different The fun is gone and those closest to you will tell you to replace that void with lame shit like cleaning or walking around aimlessly Find a new hobby well guess what all the things you used to do for fun like golf watching the big game meeting up with friends you can t really do anymore because drinking was usually involved and now it just seems like a piece of it is missing The boredom is bad watching movies you ve already seen just to pass the time Going to bed early because you don t know what else to do I ve never been one to claim the world resolves around me because it certainly doesn t All your friends will be nice to your face and say that they support you but really that is to make themselves feel good They all still go out and I don t blame them and tell you all about their fun weekend trips going to the new brewery nights out and adventures come Monday morning and then realize oh shit he probably doesn t want to hear this and then just awkwardly look at their shoes without even you having to say anything Your family girlfriend friends doctor social worker coworkers anyone who knows will instinctively look at you different Some because they actually care and some because they don t know what else to do You will lose friends and it will all happen all at once All you want is to go back the way it was but it can never truly go back even if you go ahead and pick up the bottle just to numb the pain It seems to get worse with every new person you have to tell I can t go out tonight for no good reason and you feel like some outcast to people who know you the best You end up sitting around playing with legos and building Star Wars models like an year old because you don t want to be the son that joins the club It hasn t been that long but so far sobriety sucks ass , weeks in reflection,1

745,I went out for a long bike ride on what was the first real day of fall here Riding through the park and the surrounding neighborhoods marveling at the live oaks I thought back to my early struggles with this whole God Higher Power business The live oaks are magnificent Each one entirely unique in composition but within a family There is one little section in the park with about a dozen trees and there is very clearly a grandpa live oak a grandma live oak and all their children and grandchildren There is something about them that is awe inspiring in a quiet way When I washed into AA I had a lot of very fancy ideas and complicated beliefs about God religion theology spirituality and all that biz It all rolled around in my head generally keeping me agitated and confused The book says We found that as soon as we were able to lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a power greater than ourselves we commenced to get results even though it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that power which is God lay aside prejudice You mean put down what I think I know about God religion theology spirituality and all that biz Admit that I don t have all the answers a willingness to believe Maybe try something different for a change I mean my best thinking and selfish actions are what landed me here in the first place And as I was riding it hit me I can t make a live oak I can plant a seed or sapling water it nurture it protect it and watch it grow but I m not responsible for what brings a live oak to life That power is beyond me That is a humbling epiphany Today I don t know anything about God and I have realized that for me wherever my higher power resides or whatever it really is isn t important It simply doesn t matter I have come to believe through my lived experience that my higher power doesn t care about who I believe in how I think or what my feelings on the subject are but it does care very much about my actions how I treat myself and others For the AA program to succeed in my life I don t have to subscribe to any other s view of God religion theology spirituality and all that biz My own conception is sufficient I m pretty grateful for that ,This God Higher Power business ,1

751, I had an amazing week because I didn t drink this week Why you may ask Because I was struck utmost myself from what I did last Friday that it was simply easy Last Friday I drank from pm to pm Saturday yes that s right And now after all that progress it has lured me back in It is am where I am and I don t feel myself ever wanting to stop I had a great day because of my sober week I did a lot of my work studied and even got a new tattoo Now though at I just want to take my electric bike out and ride around Meanwhile my wife is in the other room sleeping hoping to God I can just keep it together for once I promised her I d turn it all around once we got married and bought this house But yet here I am it seems as thing get better I just thrive off it and take it into my own selfish labyrinth of drinking myself into a false state but yet continually stuck in the mode that I desperately starve for Despite my goals and how I want things to be I always rock into this mode I m an engineer and have dozens of ideas that investors would fight over but yet I d rather drown in my own pity But then again I guess that is what happens when you grew up as someone everyone expected to be in prison My mother was bipolar and God knows I feel the mania and Satan knows I feel the depression because it has nearly taken my life In a nutshell I m the type of drinker that when I start I can t stop I can t stop so badly that I don t ever even go to sleep because I drink beer I ll stay up hrs drinking on the weekend without sleep just drinking I seem to just ride a high like a bipolar person on a manic trip But yet or of the days of the week I m cool and happy not drinking But normally that is all because I m still ruminating on how my last drunk totally kicked my ass It just seems to me that this drink puts a spell over me and I can t get over it I just can t beat the damn thing no matter how fucking hard I try I just keep trying and trying I know I ll quit when I have to but damn it is really kicking the shit out of me My father was an alcoholic and it lead contributed in my parents divorce when I was Later on when I was he died He buried himself in a studio apartment after the divorce drinking himself to death with a strange hint of pride I live in that apartment with him when my mom kicked me out at My grandfather died at a local bar he was a local and had a heart attack at one night My dad s brother my uncle John died drinking Listerine my uncle Bill my dads brother too was a wild drunk but an awesome man Bill ended up dying of all kinds of health complications My half brother Tony died of a heroine overdose last year at My cousin Eric died this year and was a meth addict Sure that might be me feeling sorry for myself But it is my fucking reality I don t know where to turn I m a strong and established year old man but both parents are dead all grandparents siblings live out of state and I don t even wat to think of that as an excuse I d just rather drink ,Am I Hardcore Alcoholic ,1

756,I just want a clean slate I want to be someone new somewhere unfamiliar I want to not know anyone from the life I ve had up until this point I m tired of being exactly what everyone expects me to be The latest insult my relatives have for me which I rarely know anymore is calling me an alcoholic How could they even know It s been years since I last spoke to anyone but recently I was made aware by my mother of my uncle s true feelings towards me The worst part is that I didn t feel anything when I heard what he had to say How could he call me an alcoholic when his own alcoholism resulted in prison time and a scar across his face from a drunk driving incident My only emotion is feeling numb and the desire to place the ultimate distance possible between myself and the rest of my family by just blocking everyone I was always outcasted by them before so why would now be any different They don t know how deeply I crave to live a sober life I d give anything to have a normal brain that wasn t wired to numb the pain each time it seeps in I think these message boards help me hold myself accountable without having to discuss something so personal with others I just want to reach the point where I m looking back on all of this as if it were just a bad dream ,When does it get easier ,1

758,Don t get this thread mistaken This is not to bash AA I am so grateful for it and what it has given me However this is here just to get your petty stuff down I ll go first I find that people sometimes suppress their feelings and thoughts simply to remain humble or to toe the party line I know that this is my own subjective opinion but sometimes it can grind my gears I also dislike how some meetings are so limited to sharing only of alcoholism I honestly feel that we struggle with so many other co morbidities that to limit this can make newcomers feel rejected or shunned if they do not yet identify as an alcoholic through the spiritual definition Obviously everything is in my control hear as I can always find new meetings and send love inventory those I find dishonest ,What do you dislike about AA Honest Serious ,1

768,I was cheated on and broken up with seven weeks ago I wanted to numb the pain and not feel anymore so I turned to drinking Everyone told me I was justified in what I was doing at first everyone said it s likely what they would do in my situation Now i m seven weeks post breakup and find myself drinking almost every night Before this I would have maybe a few drinks a week now i m downing a six pack a day I hate myself for this I want to come across the other side as a stronger more powerful person but instead i m disgusted with how im letting this affect me Just needing to ramble I guess Hopefully this is the start to my recovery ,Traumatic breakup months ago has led to a newfound drinking problem,1

770,I wanted to tell a bit of my story to you guys where I was what I ve done where I am now I was always the life of the party in high school the first time I had ever got drunk I don t know how to describe it really other than I felt wholesome I fell in love with how I felt Through high school whenever there were parties or even just going to a friends house for the night all I wanted to do and all I really cared about was getting drunk Looking back on it my friends would get drunk to just enhance the night a little more but when i would get drunk it was a little more personal I didn t really want to do it just for the fun of it I just wanted the sensation and that was all Fast forward to when I was years old I had got out of high school and had gone through a trade school I started working in my profession and I remember I was going through a bit of a rough patch mentally I was just miserable I was severely depressed and I used alcohol as a bit of a crutch to get me through and as time had progressed I never really noticed how far I getting into it before I was drinking every night I would drink bourbon in my room by myself every night whether I had to wake up for work at am or not And not only did the frequency of my drinking increase but so did my depression I had gotten to the point that I just didn t want to be alive anymore I felt like I had nothing to lose and had completely accepted defeat and was embracing my alcoholism Not only was I drinking every night but I had also began skipping work to get drunk I would leave work early to go home and drink I would drive to work drunk I was hell bent on staying mentally absent I began taking whatever people would offer I d smoke weed I would drink lean someone would give me adderall at work here and there It had gotten to a point where I was in so much trouble with my job because of my spotty attendance that one night I decided that I needed to get better so I broke the news to my family they were supportive they gave me help I was seeing a psychologist and an addiction specialist the psychologist wrote me some prescriptions for my depression and anxiety and that s when I fell head over heels for Xanax I began abusing those and to skip ahead at my worst I was going through pills in about two weeks time I made it through I got myself out of it What got me out of it was the fact that I wanted to You guys can do this and I believe in every one of you that you are capable Get the help you need Use your family and friends as your motivators god bless you guys,This post is for those struggling,1

787, years ago I hated alcohol even when I got it as a gift I wouldn t touch it because I just didn t like the taste or the buzz Now I ve been drinking daily for almost a year last summer I was literally puking every night and I would chug a sip of vodka before going to bed even tho I was already drunk Countless nights that I can t remember I can say I ve slowed down now and don t feel like I need to be blacked out before bed but I still drink daily I keep telling me spouse that we need to quit drinking and that I am tired of being an alcoholic but my spouse just says we don t have a drinking problem literally every adult drinks everyday Sorry buddy but I was an adult years ago and I didn t drink everyday and I was quite happy and also NO not every adult drinks every day I don t understand the thought process Why can I clearly see the problem and my spouse can not Also my spouse will deny being hammered when it s kind of obvious on nights when I am drinking less ,I know WE have a problem but my spouse seems like he s in denial,1

789,I found out this evening that a dear AA friend s spouse has relapsed My friend was so upset and confused They are going to Al Anon starting tomorrow Early on in my program someone shared at a meeting a similar situation with their spouse except they had young children too I m marrying another AA We each work our own program and have our own homegroup We support each other and cheer each other on It s a pretty awesome partnership hence the upcoming nuptials My anxiety goes through the roof when I hear stories of relapse in relationship I m afraid of my partner relapsing I m afraid I ll be the one to relapse some day I m afraid whomever doesn t relapse will have to suffer the consequences I m afraid to have children because of who we were and who we might become again What is it like having long term sobriety with a partner How do you protect your own sobriety when a partner relapses what about the children I know there is no certainty and that seems to be where my problem lies It s midnight so I ll talk to my sponsor about this tomorrow Any wisdom is appreciated ,Sober Coupling,1
790,I ll be sober one year in four days I should be happy But this isn t my first time around I had almost a year once before and then relapsed and I was out for six years During those six years I did irreparable damage to my marriage and children I m glad I m sober now but I am struggling to come to terms with the fact that I lost so much time with my children who are just about grown now and the fact that I hurt my husband so badly he wants to leave me now Ive gone through the steps with a good sponsor I ve done my best to make amends but there are some things that can t be fixed I can never make it up to my children that they grew up in an alcoholic home with an alcoholic mother My husband can never unhear the cruel things I said to him while drunk I ve just done too much damage to my marriage that it is no longer reparable and it s killing me I feel like an unloveable monster Im not a monster I know that The things I did were all pretty run of the mill alcoholic stuff I threw temper tantrums I said mean things while drunk I was not present for my kids the way they deserved I didn t hit anyone or be physically abusive yet But what I did was enough to kill my marriage and leave my children with lifelong scars On the day of my last drunk my husband said he was done and wanted to divorce I convinced him to give me six months to show him I was serious At six months he said he was unsure so we gave it another six months Now he says he loves me but he doesn t want to live with me anymore This year has been a good one in our marriage I ve gotten some emotional sobriety and I don t rave and rant anymore and I can handle disagreement without fighting We have been kind and loving to each other and I thought we were going to be okay But we arent Ive spent years with this man and we ve raised three children I thought we d be old together I don t want to drink but I kind of want to die God damn it I thought my days of sobbing in the bathtub were over,Can t deal with the damage I did,1
791,So I m years old I ve had an issue with alcohol since I was I ve tried many times to quit and yet when ever I get paid I spend it on booze A few months ago my caretaker I have extreme anxiety and can t leave the house without someone else told me i couldn t buy booze when out with her I agreed as I know I have an issuie but since then I ve taken either ubering booze when my parents aren t home or stealing alcohol from my mum like I did before I was of age to buy it It s gotten to the point where I ve started using household substances to get drunk because I can t stand being sober at times Note I have bpd and complex ptsd and my addiction started as a way to self medicate at as It was the only thing to make me feel ok I am seeing multiple professionals but alcoholism has this type of terrible self blame I can t stand I have brought it up before buy minimised the issuie I ve been waiting a year to get a new therapist since I can t do online and lockdown is a bitch The longest I ve been sober is months and that s because I spent any money I got on stupid things I m just stuck rn and my lying about drinking has stretched out to anyone important in my life and that makes it harder to get help Anyway I ve been rambling I just want to know what i can do now to help as while od love to see a therapist about this I can t Many thanks edit I forgot to put this in but the first time I called an alcohol support line i was called a stupid teen who was wasting their time even tho at that point in my life my drinking had caused a small injury in my stomach causing me to shit and puke blood,Advice please Am still suffering,1
792,Just needed some where to vent and since this event made me relapse I figured this is the best place to vent and not be judged delete if I m wrong I m a hard working man that works days a week to pay child support and still try to afford to provide for my wife and son Haven t seen my other kids in close to months but that s a whole situation the current situation that got me to relapse is this from my current wife I m always being told that im cheating since I m working so much keep in mind I started this job months ago and I m the only one working for the past few months I was recently kicked out over this being told that im living a nd life since I m working so much I broke down being human I can only take so much I caved I gave on I wasn t strong enough to keep fight the good fight it won it s been close to a year that I drank and I caved I m just lost sorry for the long read and might be pointless but the struggle is all to real Thank u for ur time and for not judging,Just here to vent,1
793,Idk how to explain it I used to like aa and now I feel like I m listening to a bunch of brainwashed people repeating the same stuff weeks ago i started drinking again and I thought it d be ok But now I m blacking out again and overall being a shitty human to myself and to others I can t show up the way I want to So I called a couple of my close friends in AA and went to a meeting I love the fellowship though I m trying to keep an open mind but I literally cringe when I hear people say they have to go to a meeting everyday to stay sober I just don t want to have to be in aa like that for the rest of my life to remain sober happy Idk man I guess I m just venting lol,How can I be in AA and not hate it ,1
794,I think maybe I have a problem but I m having a hard time committing to fixing it I drink everyday At least drinks when I try to moderate it s always more Weekends are more of course It s hard because I feel like it enables me to be more of myself I have these different modes of reliance like A celebratory you earned it it s the end of the day B coping man you ve had it rough C comfort this ll just take the edge off and D boredom fuck it I don t want to completely remove but I guess I would like to be at a place where I don t drink every single day and especially not as coping I think I ve excused my issue because of the fact that I don t really let it influence others I m not an angry or mean drunk Idk just hoping for some honest opinions ,I m new here ,1
795,As said in the title it s become harder as time goes on to really care or commit myself to this program Like my mother who used to only drink I had my stints with drug and alcohol abuse I m now and have went to my moms meetings for some time but honestly just can t give myself to AA and it s ways completely I ve been sober for a couple months now not by sheer will and white knuckling it but because the urge and want to get fucked up has honestly left I ve already been through too much and have no desire to do it all over again While it is nice and I have stability I had to move in with my mom and her husband who also is in AA where they met until December until I figure out where I am going to move I ve been here at her house for close to a month now and I ve been going to meetings to keep her happy The issue is that I feel like our relationship is now almost rooted in the program Tonight I said I don t want to go to the meeting she started accusing me of going back to old ways Again I m sober and have left that life and everyone else that came with it behind And also I am very well aware that I am staying in her home and I have to go by her rules but there was never any agreement to this What I m mostly concerned about is that my mom along with my dad are both under the impression that this is for me I can t live without it and if I don t go I m going to fuck up again While I think that there assessment is fair to an extent I also feel like I am unable to really give myself over to this program Over the last year I have tried and tried and tried I ve had sponsors home groups did some service work met some amazing people but I just can t grasp what keeps everyone walking that walk I keep being told that I am going to hear something that will just click but it doesn t happen When someone speaks I listen and have heard some good stuff but again nothing is clicking I feel like I m going crazy between my parents having been convincing me since I was young that I m not normal and fucked up and me knowing what s really going on in my head but trying to appease them while at the same time trying to apply myself to the program in it s entirety Fuck man I don t know what to do or who to turn to right now just really need some advice If you read all of this thank you I just wish that I could get it and get that urge to keep wanting to go back but it s not there ,I m struggling to fully commit apply myself to AA and it s driving a wedge between me and my parents BTW I m sober ,1

805,I just wanted to share my experience over the last hours about how working with another alcoholic has saved me It has been a very challenging time where we live we have been in a strict COVID lockdown for sometime I live alone and haven t been able to see many people Yesterday there was an Earthquake right in the middle of a suicide prevention course I was doing A very emotionally challenging time Anyway there is one passage in Bills Story which has been of particular significance for me in the last hours That when all other measures fail work with another alcoholic would save the day I have been praying a lot for God to remove my fear and direct my attention to what he would have me be and then finding myself looking for ways to work with others and finding that the fear would dissipate One way that I like to work with others is reading the big book with them I am reading the big book with another alcoholic at the moment we read a page at a time and then discussing our findings Works a treat If you are struggling to find a way out of an emotionally challenging spot then I recommend working with another alcoholic Very grateful for the sub Reddit ,Work with another alcoholic saves my day,1
806,Hi all So I have felt for some time I ve had a problem with alcohol For years I even joked about it saying it s only beer real alcoholics drink the strong stuff I m realising that I ve been convincing myself I m ok when in fact I m not I don t drink every day but probably every other day I can t remember when I started drinking like this but a few years ago I got into some legal trouble and it s dragged on and on My anxiety was and very much is through the roof Beer just calmed my nerves Skip forward to now and the last few months have been absolute psychological torture I ve had to make a phone call every day for weeks to my solicitor to see if I m being called to court the next day I split with my wife I lost my job My car is in a state of disrepair and I can t afford to fix it I rarely get to see my year old son I ve had to move back in with my parents Honestly it s a wonder it s only alcohol I turned to Believe me I considered suicide many many times Even tried but chickened out I don t have the stones for it Too much of a coward But you know what alcohol was always there for me It would change my mood around it would relax me I felt almost ethereal when drunk because I wouldn t be anxious the weight was lifted It made me stop thinking about taking my own life But it was only temporary I m at the end of my legal battle or at least this one for now and I want to mend my ways I don t know whether I should just try and cut down or give it up completely I always maintained I drink for a reason and that reason is to get drunk I see no other point in drinking unless I m gonna get wasted Tomorrow is my birthday and I want to spend it sober Tomorrow is also the day I m in court the day I told myself I d drink to celebrate the end of this whole charade But I don t want to I haven t had a drink today but I ve been hung over the whole time I m sorry I m just rambling now I just want a fresh start,Day ,1
807,It was a Monday and not the best day for me It was a date picked for me and I had to make a decision about my life Drinking no longer became enjoyable it was necessary to function And the consequences of my drinking were quickly catching up to me As I was standing in the processing line the fun part of feet on the feet spread squat thank you next I remember someone saying now is the time and keep an open mind It has not always been fun Life doesn t give me a break Sometimes the sun doesn t shine But I continue to do a quiet conversation every day with the Higher Power of my understanding and we review my character defects against what is going on in my day We review what happened yesterday and I am reconfirmed that my Higher Power will be handling all of my problems worries and concerns for the day And the kicker to that my help is not needed Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps my job is to carry a message to the alcoholic who still suffers and the only thing I am responsible for and this more of a public service attestant is to put pants on each day If you re new if you re struggling reach out for help Don t do what I did work the steps and enjoy your own recovery A life beyond my wildest dreams yes life continues to come at me but I have a tool box and a list of phone numbers of men and women who I can call if needed PS it s been years and I still go to meetings a week and I sponsor a handful of men and women to help them to understand what is the solution involves , Days Ago,1

825,For those that have many years of sobriety under your belts how often do you have moments like this For the past day or two I ve had what I would describe as serious cravings for alcohol It s funny because I m trying to talk myself into going to the liquor store and justifying it in my head but at the same time I m aware of the bullshit my own brain is telling me I can t drink responsibly I never have and I never will so why do I still feel this pull towards alcohol I m well over year of sobriety and I was not expecting this at all today , months sober and experiencing my first real craving in a long time,1
826,I m usually good all day There have been past times where I gave myself a shot of whiskey in the middle of the work day But as soon as even comes around I m downing shots of whatever whiskey I have on hand I can t deny it doesn t feel nice I feel great right now But why do I do it I must have seven shots of whiskey by now It s obviously something I hide from my partner taking a swig of whiskey and then chewing or eating something to mask the smell My mom is an alcoholic I m afraid I m just winding up in her steps I don t like it though it leads to bad choices I am hugely concerned with my weight I am bulimic but when I m drunk I order whatever I want knowing I m going to throw it up later so no loss I really dunno why I do this It s just gotten worse Should I start attending AA meetings does anyone have any advice Much love ,Drinking every night sometimes half a bottle of whiskey,1
827,Guys I think I need some help I started drinking about ten years ago I never really messed with it much until I turned I started drinking whiskey I d have a couple of drinks to wind down And then a couple of drinks eventually turned into the whole bottle Im a big guy and I feel like I need to emphasize that now It got to the point to where I was drinking a fifth every day I got sick once not alcohol related and went to the doctor and they discovered that my liver enzymes were elevated obviously They told me to stop drinking I didn t I did ease myself off the liquor and switched to beer And that was fine for awhile But then I started drinking way too much of that too I was drunk everyday until I lost my job because I d get hammered the night before I had to be there and didn t go I tried to cut back Im no longer drunk every night but on the nights I do get drunk I m drinking either strong alcohol or I m drinking well over a case of beer in a sitting It s not good I know it s going to kill me if I don t stop but I honestly don t think I can No matter what kind of trouble it causes in my life and no matter the friction it causes in my relationships I can t seem to stop I dont physically crave it It s definitely more mental for me I m bipolar and I try to tell myself that I drink because of that But thsts bullshit I tell myself I drink because of my anxiety And sometimes that s the truth The problem is that I don t stop drinking after the anxiety has gone away I keep going until I pass out and sometimes I pass out in embarrassing places like a frat boy I m middle aged I feel anxious when I don t have any alcohol And the time has come for me to finally admit that this problem isn t going to go away on its own So Im just looking for advice I can t afford rehab What can I do For the record I m not on drugs and don t plan to do any But I need something to replace the alcohol It doesn t have to offer the buzz I just need a placeholder you know Until I can break this habit Any tips are greatly appreciated Thanks guys ,Advice ,1

856,I ll try and keep it short my fianc can t hang when we go out Back when we met in high school we were both huge party animals and that also carried out into college Since then I have outgrown the party life mostly and I m a very active triathlete who loves working out My girlfriend on the other hand is not so active I m constantly trying to help her with her health goals and trying to help her be more active but she goes in and out of the gym Which is fine that s not the issue Tbh when she doesn t drink she s still a pretty clean eater and takes care of her health when she isn t vaping but that comes with the drinking The issue is every time we go out with friends or to an event probably times she will drink too much to the point where she gets this look on her face that looks like she isn t mentally there Her eyes get droopy and from there on the night always goes to shit I have gotten to the point where I always ask her to please not drink too much anytime we decide we re going out Because not drinking in a social environment isn t really a thing for us The thing is she doesn t know her limit She always tries to drink as much as everyone else but once she gets to that point where she s drunk it s like her brain completely shuts off This has been an issue for years and I ve tried many things like hard which includes days of being sober and doing other productive things to build metal toughness We got to day and lost and decided to try again in the future That little break didn t work She went maybe two weeks being able to control her drinking when we go out because she knew how big of a deal it was for me to see her control herself but after she passed the limit one time she completely fell back into that same person who doesn t stop drinking until she s back at home in her bed This has gotten so bad that every time we go on trips I can t have a good time because she gets that drunk and I have to make sure she s not falling over and to be honest it s embarrassing that my fianc acts like that We fight about this all the time but she doesn t think it s a big deal Also just btw I literally have ptsd when I dream because of the embarrassment she causes me when we go out Looking back I know realize how much pain and suffering that has caused me and recently it happened again where she gets too drunk and it ruined a night out with my coworker and his wife My fianc got too drunk and embarrassed herself again Right before she got too fucked up I told to please not drink anymore or order anymore drinks because she s getting to THAT point and I told her I would be done with the relationship if she didn t stop she grabbed the pitcher that was at the table when I was playing pool with my coworker and had another beer and got even more fucked up Till now she doesn t think she did anything wrong She has told me that she hates when she gets like that but she isn t doing anything to stop it I honestly feel like she might still be in denial about how she really gets but just tells me what I want to hear I ve come to realize she isn t taking into consideration how it makes me feel when she gets like that All she thinks about is her next drink She also makes me look like the bad guy for trying to get her to stop drinking before she gets too messed up Idk sorry if this was too long but I really love her and would love some advice on how to help Thanks in advance Oh also one more thing her dad is a huge alcoholic and her older sister is also a very bad drunk She HATES when they drink probably for the same exact reason I hate when she drinks Any advice ,My fianc can t hang ,1

860,Been sober for yrs I never considered myself an alcoholic and I m not sure whether I do now I know I have a bad relationship with alcohol I m and felt like I ve struggled with alcohol for almost years I ve been able to function for the most part Successful job relationship good friends But often have drunk alone felt like I wanted to drink more or quicker than the people around me and always would sneak drinks or deliberatelyom pour myself stronger ones I ve not had any serious repercussions other than some severe hangovers and embarrassment Over the last years I ve quit times and before that I couldn t remember a time I d gone longer than week without drinking since I was The last time I quit was because I drank like I had a death wish or something Its hard to explain but although it was a weeknight and I knew I would feel horrible the next day I just kept drinking Low and behold I woke up at am with terrible anxiety and after a hellish day or so recovering I stopped I didn t stop thinking I m an alcoholic and I didnt attend AA or anything Long story short my partner went on a business trip this week and I found myself thinking I could go and buy some alcohol and get drunk while he s away and I ve been thinking recently maybe now I ve gone so long without alcohol I could try it again The problem is the last couple of times I ve done that I just slip back into the bad habits and eventually my body and mind can t handle it anymore I don t want to label myself an alcoholic because I don t know if I really am If I can go so long without drinking and could do it without AA or rehab maybe I m just over exaggerating I suppose I find myself here because I don t have anyone to talk to about this and could use someone s perspective outside my head ,Am I in the right place ,1
861,Finally bit the bullet and went to my first meeting The meeting was all men and I am not so after the meeting I got like three numbers of women they knew in the program What do I do with these numbers I m not used to asking for help so I don t even know what I would reach out to these people for I haven t made it back to another meeting just yet I m still sort of confused about how I want to engage in the program though I plan on going back ,What to do with numbers I m given after a first meeting ,1

865,I m barely sober a couple weeks with one slip up in that time At the time I asked someone to be my sponsor I didn t know anyone and now I ve met a guy who I think would be awesome willing and available to be my sponsor Is it okay to switch My current sponsor is great he s just very busy and has his own stuff he s dealing with right now He s also been sober for years and isn t quite as active in AA anymore attending a meeting about once per month He s kind of a tough love dude which definitely has its place but I don t always get the most out of it My other guy seems more willing to chat on the phone and encourages me to call him daily and is pretty active and involved in AA attending a few meetings a week Thoughts ,Is it okay to switch sponsors early on ,1
866,I am a drunk and a liar and a cheat I ve become totally and completely unrecognisable People were kind to me and I used them either for company or for alcohol I was so scared of being alone that it cost me my relationship The irony being that I never really was alone The things I ve done and how I have behaved to people in the last years disgusts me I know who I am at my core and that isn t it I can t figure out why I would do so many terrible things to those around me who cared It crept up on me and now it s like the world is a blur and I m being passed by without really getting to live a life I lost the love of my life because I simply could not stop the compulsion was overpowering I struggle with depression and I honestly never thought I could feel this low I guess I am at the hopeless feeling that spurs on so many to finally quit I really hope it works for me too I just needed to get this out I needed to be real and true for myself and so I can finally work the program ,Everything is f ed Off my chest post,1
867,I had way too much to drink last night I pissed my chair threw up on the floor I don t remember getting into bed and I threw up all over the bed too I m writing this as I sit on the toilet with throwup in my hair I already took out the big pieces of throwup I feel so ashamed and I feel so disgusting especially since I reek of vomit I used to drink for a short time in highschool due to severe depression And well here I am again I drink hard liquor it s the only liquor I ll drink along with a melatonin at night Last night however I went overboard I don t know what to do School and work is taking a backseat for my drinking and I m ruining my own life by being so sad all the time ,Hi my name is Unfairweather I m ,1
868,Does anyone have experience with energy vampires in the fellowship I ask because I notice when I m a newcomer and especially if I pick up a white chip I ll have multiple people like surround me and almost vying to talk to me After I go to the meeting for a few weeks these same people that were so kind and welcoming barely even look in my direction I got to thinking ok now I m not technically a newcomer so they need fresh blood or almost like now I m in direct competiton with them for any other newcomers that happen to me wander in desperate and looking for help I m always told youre helping me more than I m helping you you just energized me I noticed they like to talk at you look me almost dump on you So Are recovered alcoholics like depending on a neverending supply of newcomers I know the higher power is supposed to provide the power butbwhat about people that don t believe in an almighty power and instead use the group as their power literally Like the program I ve heard has a dismal success rate so most of the these newcomers won t get long term sobriety This would mean they actually don t want everyone to recover almost like a pyramid scheme Explains why they seem so cliquey and insular sometimes or could be the high turnover rate guards are up Does this like core group of sometimes cliquey recoverd alcoholics need these newcomers to like feed off their energy to maintain sobriety Kind of like the new season of AHS Except it s sobriety to maintain and not talent I haven t experienced this give at all meetings just some like insular clubhouses mainly As a newcomer I sometimes left feeling a overwhelmed from getting bombarded and b sort of emotionally drained instead of feeling uplifted like I do at meetings not like what I describe I dunno if this sounds crazy but it makes some sense to me Tldr some aa groups use newcomers as prey for energy or sobriety vampires to maintain recoverd alcoholics sobriety ,A A Energy Vampires,1

886,I recently came to conclusion that I m an alcoholic I come from a family where heavy drinking is prevalent My grandfather uncle and father have all struggled with alcoholism None of them were able to overcome it I want to find a way to not rely on drinking as a coping mechanism but have no idea where to start I ve tried therapy on and off for years for different issues but I m not the therapy type of person Therapy truly works for some people but I ve found no progress in it I m currently looking up AA meetings in my area but there s so many to choose from I suppose that s a good problem to have Is finding aa meetings a good place to start How do I find the right place with so many options How do I get a sponsor Are there red flags I should look out for pertaining to staying sober What helped you maintain an alcohol free lifestyle What do you wish someone had told you when you first realized you were an alcoholic Any and all advice help is welcome,Realized I m an alcoholic and need help starting a sober lifestyle,1
887,I m not sure if I belong here so I thought you d he able to help me to define my drinking orientation Don t want to offend anyone I m just not sure where or from who I should ask these questions so here I am My situation is that I don t really need to drink at all Usually I m not experiencing any kind of an urge when it comes to consuming alcohol I could spend months without even thinking about a beer but the problematic part of the story is that when I nevertheless open that one bottle of wine oftentimes I do that because I m bored and someone proposes to do so and I go like gt why not I just CAN T stop drinking The one fine glass of wine is never enough for me I always want to grab an another one and another and another etc Sometimes I can get hooked in getting drunk and in that case the drinking can last for several weeks After all I always find something more fun to do after the experienced intensive boozing period and somehow just forget that I ve ever even liked alcohol So what do you think Should I try to reach help or am I even experiencing a drinking problem at all Something in my behaviour is a little bit fucked up for sure also my friends amp family have expressed their concern about my consumption but in the end I m not convinced of that the root of my issue is alcohol at all ,How would you describe my relationship with alcohol ,1
888,My name is D and I m alcoholic I posted on here a week ago and I m still going to keep posting and commenting with my no bullshit advice because that s the advice my sponsor gives me If my presence offends you that seems more like a personal problem I struggled a week ago and it was refreshing to see people rooting for my relapse and having them say I m glad you relapsed Well guess what I m still in program I am rooting for all of you I don t want any single one of you to have to drink again I believe there is A solution the steps and the Grace of God Good luck to all of you Thanks for letting me share,Thank you for celebrating a relapse,1

892,My roommate is a severe alcoholic and is a manager at a bar He drinks from the moment he clocks in until they close He drinks for free and even hangs out there on his days off Not to mention he drives home drunk after each shift I understand he needs to make money but this job is killing him He won t listen or admit it s a problem At times I wish he would get fired just so he s forced into a new career What can I do to get him out of this industry Or at the very least stop him from driving drunk I just really think the bartending industry is extremely toxic for him but it s all he knows He would have to take a big pay cut to switch professions Also that bar is his only social circle And suggestions ,Advice about roommate,1

912,Sorry if this question is stupid or has an obvious answer I m new to the whole addiction recovery process I actually started attending CoDa meetings and visit the Codependency subreddit frequently but wanted to know if sex addiction can be treated the same as alcoholism I ve just come out of a very codependent relationship with an addict who I met on Grindr a platform I ve been using since to hook up with people I ve always been horny and there s no problem with that The problem arose when I started to use sex as a proxy for emotional intimacy and connection when the pandemic started or even before that and my relationship has traumatized me to the point that I now have to treat Grindr as if it were a drink It s not good for me because it may give me the illusion of intimacy and connection but will only harm me more when I m done and the other person walks away it s literally destroying my life but I do not know how to stop it I m having horrible withdrawal symptoms and am struggling so hard right now not to download the damn thing and sleep with another man for tonight I cannot handle sleeping by myself on weekends after my last relationship tbh Imagining my addict ex enjoying orgies while high and drinking while I m here literally shaking just makes me want to do the same for fuck s sake It has brought me to the point of exposing myself to STIs exposing myself to probably dangerous people separating myself from my family losing myself in the long run because I do not know how to keep healthy relationships giving me obsessive episodes and making me violent and irascible I do not know what to do Should I use Grindr and slowly seek help without cutting off of my addiction Should I keep going cutting it off completely Thank you if you read the whole post ,Should sex addiction be considered akin to alcoholism and treated similarly ,1

937,I ve been struggling with my drinking for the better part of years since college I was a mess doing any drug and drinking anything I could find I was able to kick the drug habit but haven t been able to stop drinking Both my brother and best friend have gotten sober within the past year but I just started drinking nips in secret and hiding it from the people around me Last night my fianc found empty nips in my pocket and car after I had lied and said I wasn t drinking them anymore and I think she might be leaving for good this time I want to stop and be the person she fell in love with but I honestly don t think I can All I can say is I haven t had a drink today and I just got back from a nice walk with my dog There s nothing that hurts worse than making someone you love cry and knowing it s all your fault Any advice would be helpful as I am new to all of this and try to salvage what may still be left of my relationship ,First day sober in months,1
938,Are ahead of me I m on my own no supervision Only hours sober It s tough when your counting sobriety by the hour I envy those of you days weeks years ahead of me This is where I fall into old patterns It s Friday I always stop at the liquor store for vodka or tequila Or both I load up for the weekend In the last few months I ve had to switch to new stores My usual would have bottles on the counter waiting for me I was like clockwork And yet recently I felt very stupid walking in there My addiction was so predictable to people who s names I don t even know I have a lot of projects lined up this weekend to keep me busy My mind at bay But I m still nervous and anxious I suppose that s normal Those bottles waiting for me on the counter will be lonely F cking mind games ,A few tough hours,1
939, First off I d like to be honest with you all I didn t work the program I have nothing against it I was just scared I guess I went to a few meetings I got a sponsor but I wasn t ready and I wasn t going to waste anyone s time Next thing you know one week turned into one month and then a year and now two It just kind of happened like that I like to think we all end up in the same place no matter the path taken This my journey Now that that s out of the way My names Eric and I m an alcoholic I was a social drinker then an every weekend drinker then an every night drinker and then just a flat out drunk Wake up grab a pull of whatever I had to take the edge off and start my day Drink before work Drink at work At some point or another it became routine maintenance I had become an alcoholic and my life was anything but manageable It all seemed to happen so fast When did this happen I knew at a younger age I was going to have to stop drinking I just knew it I m a very obsessive person I don t really do many things half ass drinking included Oh a shot Give me the bottle I m all in and mph in which never direction chooses me In my twenties I did the thing You know single hung out with my friends and avoided anything that could be permanent or make me change a relationship I finished college and started doing what I wanted to do I went to acting classes I wanted to be Marlon Brando I still do Acting was my obsession at the time and alcohol was something I had a decent control over But at some point the alcohol took over When I first moved to L A a co worker of mine mentioned a story about a guy This guy was so talented but he drank a thirty pack a day So he never got to be an actor It wasn t until I had a handle of whisky in my bedroom I started to think wait am I becoming that guy No way You re a struggling actor You re an artist Be tortured throw your inhibitions away and write like Hemingway Miller or Williams There s no way you ll die like them I was malicious I was angry I was misunderstood I had a chip on my shoulder the size of a fifth of vodka I moved back to St Louis At the time people thought it was because I was homesick nah I went where the party was I felt like I was missing out John Goodman has this great interview where he talks about how alcohol was one of the main deciding factors on him moving to New Orleans He wanted to be where the alcohol was Alcoholic s have one thing in common they all think alike After a year or so of spoiling my liver and falling deeper and deeper into my alcoholism the party suddenly ended I met a girl Now the secrets out There s another person who knows how much I drink She gets a front row seat to my one man show I am now slowly becoming more and more aware of this lifestyle that is slowly swallowing me whole and becoming my number one priority Everything else that I loved or had a passion for took the back seat to my daily habit She was a drinker as well Her and I used to drink every night So in love talking in circles only to end up right back where we started I wouldn t trade those times for the world but sometimes it feels like those were two completely different people back then Her family was more open about the program and being an alcoholic I thought it was weird I knew everything Don t over communicate it don t dissect it just don t I m a man Yeah A little over a year in she decided to get sober She went to meetings a week worked the steps got a new job did her passion stuff on the side started getting more fit laughing more she was flat out flourishing Then there s me angry as hell in the passenger seat whining about how my mom doesn t love me Then there s me complaining about how I look physically Then there s me ranting for three minutes straight blacking out in between only to come to when everyone is looking at me like I have five fu kin heads She never pressured me or gave me any ultimatums She knew this was hard but being in a relationship with two people is hard as well Dialogue was had frequently and I like most alcoholics get angry when the dialogue is centered around my drinking So I do what most alcoholics do in this situation I took offense You don t think I can do it Okay So I d quit I d go three weeks here A month there Then I d take one drink and say see ya later to anything and everything The last straw happened before we were supposed to take a trip to Chicago for a concert I had not had a drink for days We were doing great She was proud and happy and I was proud of myself as well I had one drink while working a wedding a fuc ing Moscow Mule Those Russians they ll get ya I was off Drunk three days before the trip the whole trip and the way home She didn t accompany on my week long bender she stayed home It was the first time in my life I realized I chose drinking over someone who truly loves me for me I gutted through the trip I faked it I was sad and on the verge of breaking down Checking my phone every five minutes Nothing She was done I could feel it So to cope I drank enough to kill a small horse that weekend All kinds of crap Stupid stuff that I never drink Italian cordial shots and weird stuff like that I was with a traveling salesman you get the picture Now I ve never really had panic attacks Anxiety yeah But a full blown this is it this is where I die right here on this couch in someone s living room type of mental breakdown never really happened to me I was close a few weeks prior but I just chalked that up to being tired It s always something other than alcohol The last day I woke up and knew a panic attack was coming I could feel something that I had never really felt before Most likely the same feeling you feel right before you die So I did what I normally did when I felt like I was losing my mind I ran from it I grabbed the first bottle I could find Gin Yeah gin should do the trick and I mixed it with some Tang at am Tang Like it s I gutted it down Only two hours until I get on the train four more after that and I m home I just have to get home I get a cab barely The gin and tang buzz has me making best friends with the cabby So funny how drunks always think people are their best friends when in reality they re just drunk at am Anyway the impending doom had subsided for the time being I get to the station and have to sprint to my train I m rarely ever running behind like I said unmanageable I get on the train I ll fall asleep wake up and be home Nope Closed my eyes for about twenty minutes and the panic starts to come back I m starting to sweat I m tired Little dots and stains cross my vision my head is fogged and bogged down I m dying for sure on this train this is it I can t do it I make my way to the bar car I manage to tame the shakes as I swipe my card It s just me a very slow and stoic bartender and my medicine I felt about two feet tall as I sit alone in a booth staring out the window trying to find something interesting or hopeful in the never ending fields of Kansas I begin to cry And cry And cry The bartender s just looking at me the way anyone would look at a grown man who is drunk at am and crying For straight hours I had tears running down my face and a cold plastic cup in my hand to help get me through it I listened to songs on repeat Last Time and Change Love over and over again All I kept thinking about was how I let my person down I continue to let myself down I am not a good brother I am not a good son I am not a good role model I am slowly becoming a statistic and there is zero chance I will ever become anything close to significant if I keep this up Then it hit me holy shit I have to stop drinking I lived in Vegas for a few years What a great place for a drunk right One of my best friends had a grandfather who quit drinking cold turkey When you re in your mid twenties that seems insane and unimaginable I didn t believe it Then they pointed to a bar stool and said he drank his beer said I m done and never went back to it I thought that was incredible That story always stuck with me Every once in a while someone will say something significant to you Something about it will resonate and you realize they weren t saying it to you they were saying it for you That story made so much more sense to me on the train it clicked I believe I felt for the first time what my friends grandfather may have felt that day The parties over man You re done You did your dance with the thing and you ve been off beat for too long Your life and family are more important than this pint You re done So I get home I call my girlfriend and tell her I think I m ready What do I need to do I will do anything you ask of me I need help We talked and I cried and she cried and then I get off the phone I grab two airplane shots of whisky and four beers I wasn t going to get drunk I was weening myself off I know I did it the way you re not supposed to I should ve checked into a clinic or hospital but I didn t Something seriously bad could ve happened to me and I do not recommend anyone else doing the same I know myself I had to go through it alone and face myself Just me my mirror and my thoughts That s all I wanted That and the occasional sip of a beer or whisky to keep the edge off What I went through that night and the following day I wouldn t wish on my worst enemy I ve had hangovers This was my body saying yeah do it again Come on Drink again and we will shut your sh t down for good There s a scene from the movie Basketball Diaries where Jim is coming off of heroin that s how I felt Not as dramatic because it s Leo but that s how I imagined I looked I made it through it And I m happy to say I haven t had a drink since Today marks my two years and I am very proud of myself My girlfriend and I are better than ever Both sober After I was sober for six months I was finally ready to move back to L A where I can pursue my thing and she can get her masters All was good Then about three weeks after we settled in the whole world shut down Yeah perfect Two recovering alcoholics leaning on one another in a new city If I was still drinking there s no doubt I would ve drown in my apartment complexes swimming pool I mean this lockdown was a drunks wet dream Free money no meetings or work I am so grateful I chose to get sober when I did Since being sober I ve made two short films got into some festivals made a web series writing a feature now made some music that I ve wanted to make since I was gained some weight lost some weight got a therapist and plan to ask the girl I used to drink with every night to be the person I share a home with for the rest of our lives I don t have a problem being around alcohol Do the thoughts creep in Of course Hell the last two weeks have been extremely tough This subreddit helps a lot I don t judge envy or resent anyone who s able to drink I couldn t do it and that s the simple truth It s not their fault I can t do it it s mine There are plenty of things I can t do so I don t do them I wrecked every motorcycle I got on when I was a kid so I stay away from them as an adult I Can t Drink You think a person who can t swim dives off a boat in the middle of the ocean No they know They Can t Swim Because they tried it and they almost died It s not that simple but it kind of is I had to admit I was powerless over alcohol admit defeat swallow my pride and give of myself to my sobriety To all my guys out there it s okay to lose It s okay to cry It s okay to be in pain It s okay to admit defeat No matter how big or strong you you think are this thing is just as big and strong but not undefeated For everyone who thinks it s hopeless or you ll never stop it isn t hopeless and you will stop if and when you decide to Listen when people tell you they love you because you are loved If you ve got a couple hours days weeks months or years sober be proud of yourself Be kind to yourself Be patient with yourself Sobriety is hardly ever a linear path Keep going I promise you there is nothing in life that alcohol has made better Being present with your emotions and planted in the moment are the greatest joys life can give you I could slip up tomorrow I don t know What I do know is I m two years sober today and my fingers hurt Sincerely EC It s hard to be the better man when you forget you re trying It s hard to be the better man when you re still lying Handcuffs By Brand New I ll post a link in the comments to some of my projects Hope you find them enjoyable ,Celebrating Two Years of Sobriety Today minute read ,1
940,The anxiety seems to be going My body feels calmer I haven t had physical cravings since finishing step Yet I m nervous about not getting the cravings as I m just not used to it I finished step seven and then had therapy mins later on my zoom and I basically told my life story to my therapist and told him I d been leaving stuff out It all seemed insignificant to hold back after finishing step Felt like I d be cheating myself if I didn t spill all to him And yet I m not anxious over it It s like I ve had a continuous shrug towards everything that would effect me before Step took me three days On day one I felt empathy the first time for people I was holding resentment over On day two I felt anxious and then when I finished day three I had moved to step it went silent inside me Like memories barely there Complete the steps guys,I ve been sharing my journey here and I m currently about to start step on Monday I feel different,1

945,Hi I ve commented on a few peoples posts and tried to help but haven t actually posted until now because everyone else s achievements have all seemed so much greater than mine but anyway I thought I d post a small achievement I feel proud of So this is day for me completely sober with the help of The Big Book support of my parents and also this group thank you Before this I had tried and failed on more occasions than I care to admit But this time feels different I m years old and drank a bottle of vodka every single morning at am as soon as the shop opened I then functioned as usual until going back to the shop rinsed and repeated this for about years every single day only stopping when I was passed out I then tried to stop which ended in a hospital stay and the most severe withdrawals and dt s actually assaulting a nurse and throwing a fire extinguisher at another because of how bad the dt s were I have never hit anyone in my entire life Anyway I feel after admitting I was powerless to alcohol and conceding that I could never be normal and control the alcohol the weight lifted off my shoulders I focused on myself and took Antabuse every day which I m still on I am due my license back for driving next month last year I was due it back but due to a previous ban and blood test result I was told I was too high risk and know that any blood test now will show alcohol During this time I have also managed to start successful businesses which I also owe thanks to everyone who have helped me I m thinking clearly for the first time in about years now I by no means feel like I m over this or cured because this is a life long fight but I do know that if you have the belief and strength most importantly the will power you can change your life around alcohol is a drug and this is a disease for us all day is a check point as this is a marathon and not a sprint I hope to be where a lot of you guys are and writing on here in years time celebrating that milestone but for now it s day at a time Have a great weekend everyone and thanks again from a bit of a lurker but your input has made me feel less alone and has helped more than you know , days sober and everything to look forward to ,1
946, Years ago I get nervous with flying and so the night before I flew I drank about it A friend gave me a pill to help not knowing how much I drank I came to on a flight not knowing where I was or where I was going because of how far out my blackout reached The flight attendant was standing over me as people exited the plane I stood up and ran off scurrying underneath her armpit I left my carry on on the plane and made my way outside bumming cigarettes until I was fully aware Finally made my way to lost luggage and watched the flight attendant drag my bag in angrily saying nothing My family was waiting for me in that city and I couldn t explain why I was stuck at the airport Flash forward months and the person who was sitting next to me on the flight saw me at a bar I bartend He asked if I remembered anything and no of course not He told me that everyone had asked to move away from me on the flight He told me exactly my behavior and had his beer and left I could see the sheer disgust in his face And rightfully so If you think about drinking today this is one of my many spiral stories where I ve learned I can t handle the casual drink I feel better with water and I don t wake up anymore not knowing Will we always be our past Meh I don t think so But we do make lasting impressions I can do better with making life better for the people around me I WAS making it worse ,If you re feeling bad ,1
947,After years struggling with booze I ve finally said enough I spent last summer drowning in self pitty destruction and desperation Not that it changed much Until recently The past year dealing with the loss of my job reputation family and friends I returned back to the trusty bottle In the midst of the chaos I realized that something HAD to change During my own recovery I felt an urgent need to share mine and others stories tools and findings with other people going through the same Here s where you come in I m building an online program for people questioning struggling and or wanting to make a change with respect to their relationship with alcohol I ve created a survey to help decipher this deeply complex and personal struggle to shed light on more ways to help others If you ve had your life negatively impacted by drink and would like to share you d be doing a huge favour to the world Thank you in advance https form jotform com https form jotform com ,Help ,1
948,I ve been getting drunk at least times a week for ish months and I kept trying to stop bur was only able to if I physically couldn t drink for some reason My longest streak was days because I went on vacation with my parents and I couldn t sneak alcohol plus I got incredibly sick so getting drunk wasn t really on my mind at the time I recently adopted a month old kitten and had to take another round of antibiotics so I took it as an opportunity to stay sober and I m proud to say I ve made it days with only a few mild urges to drink here and there However today one of my college classes was canceled after I made sure to wake up early enough to make it on time and even went to get coffee before and that just sent me over the edge I m still on campus so I couldn t get any alcohol but I was so close to saying fuck it and buying a bottle of vodka and now I m afraid I m going to cave soon since my mom is having a birthday party today and there will obviously be alcohol and so many opportunities to sneak drinks Not only that but I m so I can just buy alcohol myself but the temptation of having it the house is so much and I ve been able to resist it because my parents know I have a drinking problem but I can t talk about it with them because they re not supportive whatsoever and will just guilt me and ask if I need to go to rehab which makes me feel worse Any tips for staying sober ,Hit days sober and I suddenly got the overwhelming urge to drink,1

950,I stumbled upon this and thought I d share In Alcoholics Anonymous we learn that resentment is a condition or state of mind whereby one relives some past event and feels the emotion from that event as if it were happening right now Resentment is literally to feel sentire again re and it is the fuel that feeds the fires of our addictions Re feeling That really makes sense to me Its hard to live a happy life when I m re feeling the emotions of past events constantly Its even harder to stay sober re feeling all that stuff so I drank more The more I drank the more there was to be resentful for It was a never ending cycle for me The steps helped shed those resentment and today I no longer re feel the emotions of those past events Im grateful for AA ,Best explanation of what a resentment is ,1

954,So I have been struggling to quit drinking for the last years I managed to make it till months on several occassions and obviously it felt amazing to be sober for that long Lately I noticed that I have mild physical withdrawal symptoms after a hard night and I ve been drinking to avoid that especially when I wake up at the middle of the night I want to stop in July I had another weeks sober but then relapsed What I feel now and always before an abstinence attempt is this general fear for my wellbeing and health but what s crazy for me is that I fear that not drinking will kill me I never have really bad withdrawals usually they go away in a few hours after my last drink Any advice ,Wanting to stop,1

958,I do not know how I functioned before but now I am craving so much I had missed before and I am loving life The hard part is picking up the mess left behind I did it by myself but really it was my kids that gave me the push the story is almost supernatural in nature really and it gives me chills thinking about it Never give up never surrender I know it sounds cheesy but for me it was something I could say and mean focus on it there are only more better days ahead and suffering is a condition of life not a quality of spirit Alcohol causes your body to be in pain and raises you bad hormonal responses and makes us quick to anger or sadness while you are consistently dehydrated causing more problems I am so glad I am to this point ,It s been about a month and a half ,1

961,I don t know why I m posting here honestly I don t want to spin up some sob story or go on a rant about how AA doesn t work or is god overloaded and unscientific I may have done that years ago but I had a psychic change truly that was the result of throwing myself into the middle of AA for years and putting it first above everything The result is my life unfolded into something better than I could have ever imagined and my horizons continue to expand I m no longer plagued with the inescapable urge to drink or do drugs and have long since learned that wasn t the issue to begin with and have grown and changed though writing meditation working with others service etc I don t want to do any of it anymore I m fully immersed in an isolation lifestyle and really don t want to see anyone or do much of anything I still attend a few meeting a week and an H amp I but have fallen out of touch with my sponsor stopped daily practices never open the book or do writing or work with new people anymore I ve sponsored a small nation of newly sober alcoholics I live in an area with a high prevalence of recovery homes and facilities so there is a never ending stream of people raising their hand looking for a sponsor and done service at many levels from the individual to the intergroup and more and have learned a lot about myself etc But I m not immune to the slow latent degradation in perspective and outlook that plagues an alcoholic like me Time alone and distance from the center means a slow moving lens starts to color my vision again and I m the last one to realize it as I become convinced that they the job the money the girl the property the prestige is the problem and not me I know all this because I ve been here before there is more than one surrender in long term sobriety especially for an emotional child neurotic alcoholic like me and letting go growing up is hard to do But I ve had some falling outs with people I was once very close to and friendships and relationships that ended so callously it s hard to show my face at my homegroup of almost years anymore because they are always there and they won t speak to me I just want closure on some of these things I want resolution and thought it was in the nature of an alcoholic that is practicing the principles to be kind and loving and tolerant But I am so hurt by how I ve been treated by some ex friends in the program and these people won t answer a call text or say a word to me yet sit across from me at a table in a group of men on a weekday evening that I love and I am so uncomfortable and frustrated by that These are friends I ve spent holidays with I know their families spent long hours on calls discussing sensitive topics as we do and they ve been rocks in my life people I can depend on And I within months was essentially ghosted by them No calls texts etc after relatively small disagreements I ve never experienced this type of thing in my life even when I was drinking using I ve been able to mend relationships and am regularly in touch with at least close friends of roughly years or more And my head tells me this is what AA is composed of People that justify and rationalize behavior like that behind the guise of spirituality and through some warped lens have found it okay for some reason to be incredibly cold to a good friend I am I know that and still get up at the podium and preach love and tolerance I can t get that record to stop and its driving me out the door , years sober and drifting from AA,1
962,Just curious as I have started saying the Serenity Prayer the way it is written on page of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions God grant us the serenity to accept the things we cannot change Courage to change the things we can And wisdom to know the difference I love this one as in my recovery I have found that this is a program and fellowship of we not me I have been in one group where they tried to change it in the Group Conscience however I do not believe this is the correct way about it as it is just forcing people to say something they may not be ready to accept Which version do you use Do you see a difference between the version on pg in the amp the original prayer Why do you think Bill Wilson has two versions within the same book ,Who else uses the Serenity Prayer on p of the amp ,1

971,When I met my first sponsor we talked about what my program with her might look like and what she expected of me At some point in the conversation we started talking about the th step and I was adamant that I wouldn t forgive the man who r ped She stopped me there and told me that an amends does not equal forgiving the person who harmed me It s about finding peace with what happened and ether I chose to forgive the person or not was entirely separate What she said really changed my perspective and I ve since chosen to make amends with my past whether that be forgiving some people or just making amends with it HOWEVER when I speak on this I tend to get quite a bit of pushback from people who insist that making amends means that forgivenesses has to be involved My question is what are your viewpoints ,What are your thoughts on amends forgiveness ,1

976,My bf has gone off the deepened since his fathers Death four months ago He was holding strong for a couple weeks but then bombed when it came time to actually go to his dads funeral in another state He got so drunk he missed the flight and funeral completely Since then he has lost his job not cared one bit and has been drinking like proof shots along with alcohol a day for over two months now He had a seizure trying to detox because his stomach hurt so bad he physically couldn t drink Spent days in the hospital and he s back to drinking worse off than he was before He has had a problem with alcohol in the past before I know him We met in rehab years ago I have been sober ever since and my drinking before rehab was a clear joke to what the heck he is doing now Like buying shooters at once is fucking crazy He says no to seeing a therapist psychiatrist going to live in a sober home going back to rehab Even going back to the hospital He is drunk of the time I talk to him now I go over to his house to clean up and make sure he showers and stuff hits it s gotten to the point where it s exhausting And coincidently his mom is having to deal with this DOUBLE because his older sister is doing the exact same shit His sister has actually gone to rehab and stuff but she called me the other day and either she s just a plain lunatic or she s back to drinking her thoughts were all over the place It was sad how intoxicated she sounded because I know how exhausted their mom must be He tells me he loves me but whenever I bring up stopping drinking or anything of the sort he gets super mad and tells me when I talk about that stuff it only wants him to drink more I ve tried EVERYTHING to stop his drinking His dumb ass mom thought he needed a new debit card like a month ago to help with an old joint bank account they had that was affecting her credit because he had a past due amount so I helped him get one and turns out it was resolved months ago so he never needed that new stream of income which was dollars he got from his dad So now not only does he think he doesn t need to work but he s gonna die people And he doesn t feel bad at all that I had to watch him have seizures and have to call the police I want to know if I can like hire very big strong men to hold him at gunpoint for like weeks just so his mind is back to normal He s usually normal dude very into working out and his health but his whole mentality has been I m fine I m gonna do what I want I don t care anymore like what can I do I ve considered taking his debit and ID card and driving them to his mom who lives an hour away or and taking his alcohol away He says both those things he would call the police on me on because it would be stealing Like what would the police do I m actually concerned he would do that so I m really curious lol I need help and I don t know what else to do besides force him into some moments of clarity so he can make a good decision because right oh get now he is so drunk all the time he can t even remember conversations we ve had or the day it is let alone make a choice to be sober ,How bad would this be ,1

997, week no alcohol no weed I m a year old male who has been drinking and smoking weed daily since sophomore year of college My girlfriend lives with me and also enjoys dancing with the devil I admitted to myself several months ago that I m an alcoholic plain and simple Ever since then I ve been trying to navigate the challenging journey of sobriety with several failed attempts I would stop for a few days and then think I had everything under control How wrong I was The day after having a drink I d find myself waiting at the liquor store at am waiting for it to open so I could have my six pack and then smoke half a gram of distillate thc My first failed attempts were a result of me only putting one foot forward and not both I thought to mysef I ll smoke weed to help take my mind off the alcohol but as i m sure others can relate to that only made my cravings worse Not just that but it made my thinking and decision making skills go out the window Of course I ended right back at square one But not this time I m days totally sober and am feeling much more optimistic in life Don t get me wrong the first days were brutal I had night sweats hands shaking incredibly irratible mood but I knew that this was just my brain chemistry changing and the process of toxin removal had begun I found what helps me most is reading what others have gone through and what works for them Knowing i m not alone in this journey has brought some peace of mind and given me confidence That being said I know my journey has just begun and I have an enormous amount of work to do Here are some tips that have been helpful to me thus far in the early stages Exercise daily and go for walks This helps take my mind off the cravings in a healthy way Tell your loved ones and close friends about your intentions to stay sober Nothing is worse than having a family member or girlfriend asking if you want a beer atleast for me during the early stages hopefully this will pass Listen to podcasts This is a great way to combat bordom and there are so many different topics to listen to Netflix Video games music hobbies sports all help immerse yoursef in something other than drinking Stay strong Peace and good vibes to all ,My name is Kyle and i m an alcoholic Today I am days sober ,1

999,Year after year I knew in the back of my mind that my drinking was a problem After drinking my first year of college none of my roommates wanted to live with me anymore and they felt strong enough about it to warn all our other friends not to move in with me I moved in with my girlfriend and we drank our nights away I never graduated Ten years later my drinking never quite seemed to get any better People were moving on with careers and families I had a sense I was being left behind I knew it as a fact there was no way to quit and that no one on earth could help me I thought if only I could take months off from work to hike the Appalachian Trail AT I would be isolated enough from my drinking buddies and my drinking lifestyle that would have to do the trick I d had no choice but to be sober out there on the trail it would be hard to find anything to drink with just the contents of my backpack That false mindset a fake belief that I could only get sober by being on what amounted to a deserted island was exactly what my disease told me to keep me drinking I was never able to quit work and hike the AT I kept working and drinking another ten years The truth is AA WOULD have worked and it doesn t require me to quit my job to do it I was hiking today as this all came back to me I realized that whenever I start romanticizing having a drink it s always tied to some past feeling An experience that is long since gone and simply does not exist anymore Drinking is never going to bring back this old sensation that only lives in my memories The AT isn t going to get me sober But when I start working the AA program with honest intentions I can get sober One day at a time ,I never got sober on the AT,1

1013, months this time Don t know why I even bothered trying again What s the point of staying sober It s changes nothing Even going sober for a year didn t help Should ve learned my lesson after that Hell it s actually worse in a lot of ways And if it doesn t make me feel any better what s the goddamn point Then again there s not really a point to anything At least being drunk is filling in time

for someone to not give two shits about any of it because life sucked long before the fucking pandemic showed up on the scene and it ll suck long after it s gone I don t leave the house and death sounds like a dream to me so what the hell would I be distressed about Anyway minutes of explaining all this once again and the dude just goes silent like he doesn t know how to handle someone as far in the pit as I am Not sure what clients he expects in that field but maybe I really am an overachiever when it comes to being suicidally depressed Either way I just told him this shit isn t helping and told him I don t need his services anymore He thanked me for my honesty Hah Closest thing to funny I ve heard in a while Cept for the sick joke I call my life think that one will always be on top And so here I am worthless damn loser drinking alone once again Cause I m a goddamn failure A miserable alcoholic Just like my worthless piece of shit father I d tell myself it s genetic but I don t

1014,When I was in AA I felt like I had to be a perfect person because I couldn t curse I couldn t have sex the first year and I couldn t even be human It became traumatic I couldn t even curse I Celebrated a year and I told them I graduated college and they said watch out no new changes the first year These people are the most negative uptight people avoid them at all costs,I feel like AA Is too much pressure and focus too much about beating the members up with guilt and remorse,1

1017,So I just booked flights to the UK Ireland for the holidays Dec Jan to see family and to visit my partner s family Woohoo Except now my mind goes to drinking I m feeling very conflicted The last time I was abroad I was didn t drink at all except maybe a glass of wine or two I feel like I ll be missing out if I don t have at least one night out I also wonder haven t I earned at least one night Just one night to live a little especially while I m on vacation But then I also know exactly how that could turn out And history shows it won t turn out well I should also add that I had a slip recently after years of sobriety I m now weeks back but continue to have strong cravings My depression and anxiety have been bad but booking this trip which has given me something to look forward to has quelled that a bit It s also made me realize that had I not gotten sober for that period of time I wouldn t have had the money for this trip I wouldn t have been able to repair the relationships with the family I ll be visiting and I wouldn t be in what is overall a pretty healthy relationship like the one I have with my partner I have a fantastic sponsor who I plan to talk to about all this I also go to meetings regularly and I ve started to attend church regularly as a way to further explore my relationship with God I just wish the cravings would go away or the depression anxiety that seems to be contributing to those cravings would ease up a bit I m on step four and have been for a little while now I m starting to think maybe I just need to rip the bandaid off and get through with it All this is to say any advice support words of wisdom and or kindness is welcome ,Traveling Abroad,1

1029,Please forgive if this post isn t at the right place here but everything that happened took place in AA I am absolutely not trying to criticize AA or anything I just wanted your take on it or some advice I m a F months sober Since January I ve been had a sponsor who is very nice but doesn t ever seem to reprimand me She also seems very busy and she often doesn t answer the phone and our stepwork sessions often get cancelled Sometimes because of her work sometimes because it s her wedding anniversary etc To be honest I don t feel as if I ve made that much progress this year For the record I do at least meetings per week and I have service positions amp x B Then a little while ago a female fellow fella called M reached out to me She s years old and nearly years sober She was primarily in NA but wanted to transfer to AA She apparently had the same sponsor although I didn t know She too felt very neglected by our sponsor From what M was telling me I could make up that she had a problem with pretty much everyone in NA She was also telling me a heck of a lot of gossip about people from the program I didn t tell her to stop that which I know is wrong But it gets worse At some point after nearly days of listening to her gossip I reached to one of the people she d been gossiping about and told her I told person X that M had been gossiping about her X was obviously furious and called M up M then apparently turned the tables and now X has blocked me and from what I ve heard never wants anything to do with me again M then retaliated and badmouthed me a guy from the program I had been seeing and about whom I had complained to her Technically I gossiped about him too which wasn t very nice of me So now that guy has blocked me too amp x B I know it s my fault that I told person X that M had been gossiping about her No clue why I did it Certainly not spiritual of me to do If I hadn t done that M wouldn t have retaliated Now my sponsor basically lost it too Not sure what to do here Yeah I guess the standard AA answer would be to look at my own part and make amends But at this point I just wanna leave amp x B TLDR I engaged in gossip and now a few people have been turned against me ,Treachery and Treason within the fellowship,1
1030,Good Afternoon I have months sober after a relapse of six years sober and am on step but my resentments regarding my sexual relationship with my wife of years resurfaced so I reworked it and saw where I was wrong and being selfish I was able to put this resentment behind me again It burns me open when it s present I See things through her eyes and that she has struggles being she was molested as a child Dead bedroom is past years as she has realized her sexual abuse has effected her more then she has thought Not dead but one sided towards my pleasure and I long to give her pleasure I am past the resentment again and we do have sex but it s rushed and it s one sided towards my pleasure I haven t been able to give her an orgasm in years plus but she sees a counselor weekly and is working on it I can t touch her in certain areas and it s always the same hurry up and get it over and about my pleasure Bet that sounds like nothing but resentment Now I don t force her and really try not to pressure her but I am sure some or my advances are pressure like although they are playful and gentle So she is the one to always initiate and I think it s because she feels like she has to and at times it s because she wants to make me happy But isn t that having sex for my own selfish sexual needs If the other person has no interest in Sex isn t that me having sex for my own selfish needs It says in the big book to work toward your ideal sexual partner through prayer for the right ideal to question each situation and pray for strength to do the right thing If that doesn t work we help others to over come the urge Well my ideal sexual partner is someone that is just as interested in receiving sexual pleasure as giving it and can be open to the spirituality and curiosity of sex Not sure if this will ever happen again We are in marriage counseling years and little change on the intimacy front So I struggle with my own selfish needs even when she initiated and my ideal sexual partner Big book seams to be real vague in this regard So if I am suppose to strive towards my ideal sexual partner but how is that possible when the other person isn t interested I really struggle with own selfish needs and being able to express myself sexually with a open and willing partner Thanks ,Ideal sexual partner and dead bedroom situation ,1

1045,i need to tell you guys about this group that started in Atlanta this group is absolutely insane listen i ve been in AA for years in atlanta complete abandon is not AA and i do not condone going to their home group or meetings it used to be in stone mountain and i believe it s in doraville now i know some people that have been able to get out and what they do is basically brainwashing they prey on newcomers trying to get sober they claim their way is the best way to get sober it isn t true they force newcomers to immediately start recruiting others if you don t meet your quota they berate you in front of the entire group and you have to be a slave for the entire week basically getting cussed out and forced to do another persons work for a whole week they skim off of your paycheck each week they claim that outside AA meetings are bullshit and only go to outside AA meetings to recruit and gather information then they go back to their home group and literally have meetings that make fun of the outside meeting they say that if you leave you will drink and die and that s how they get you to stay out of fear like all cults they make you cut ties with family and friends they told one guy i know to quit his job and get rid of his dog if he actually wanted to stay sober they don t approve of any medications either i know people that have told me people have died in their care because they were overseeing detoxes which is so dangerous people have killed themselves because complete abandon forced them to get off of their psychiatric medication claiming that the group will cure you not meds it s so wrong this crazy stuff all happens gradually over time initially they are very convincing and kind but really it s just to recruit more members this group is a cult they will brainwash you and ruin your life i am sober through regular approved AA and i am so angry they are stealing people s freedom AA says we get to be joyous happy and free this isn t freedom this is a prison designed by sick people to somehow gain control over having control of others it s sick and wrong warn everyone you know ,complete abandon cult,1

1050,Hi gonna just put this all out and would love some feedback I partied hard in college but no harder than anyone else After a few years out I realized I was still drinking socially and ocassionally after a workday eventhough it just numbed my emotions and made things worse I mean like I would drink drinks a week and possibly on a night out In college those numbers were week and on an ocasional night out Never blacked out never been in trouble never hid my drinking though I have made some dumb choices when drunk After a while alcohol stopped agreeing with me So I decided to stop I notice that it s challenging that my friends pressure me and that alcohol is actually a very common thing around my life I associate it with fun and it s hard to have fun without it I realized it was challenging to stop so I decided to go to AA meetings this weekend The stories I heard were so terrible the amount of alcohol so drastic that I really felt like I didn t belong Is AA for alcoholics or for anyone who simply wants to stop drinking I really feel I don t belong I m confused about what support system I can have Any advice Anyone here a moderate drinker who found success with AA ,I m confused if AA is right for me as a moderate drinker who wants to stop please advise ,1

1058,Hi All I am really struggling to accept the fact that my ex won t even acknowledge my amends request he is completely avoiding and blocking me since breaking up in active addiction I am over a year sober now He has withdrawn from most people and his parents still contact me every now and again I just don t understand why he d block me and refuse to talk to me for so long I know I m probably in the wrong but I just can t understand why he continues to prolong the pain for both of us we never had the chance to discuss our break up it just all ended over the phone one night obviously largely due to my drinking the way we broke up and why we broke up the endless fighting around it It s just incredibly painful for me because he s leaving me hanging and the few times we have spoke he has sent me mixed messages saying we will talk again etc etc but then he blocks me out of the blue for months on end again I don t know it s just all very emotionally confusing to me I don t understand why he can t just acknowledge the amends I sent him or just rather lay it on me RE why he is angry at me instead of giving me the silent treatment and no closure Any tips on how to handle and accept this Acceptance RE a bad reaction or no reaction to an amends or extreme unforgiveness when you ve worked your ass off on repairing your life and relationships and being better It just gets really really discouraging PS I know amends is about owning responsibility for your actions etc but I m sure everyone has felt that hurt deep down of someone not accepting it even if it is not about you and a selfless act Thanks ,Ex of yrs refuses to talk to me or acknowledge my amends ,1

1060,This is my first time posting Earlier this year I saw a PCP for the first time in a couple years and a few months ago I was diagnosed with fatty liver disease due to slightly high liver numbers The doctor told me to stop drinking but I haven t I m years old and never really considered myself an alcoholic but I do have a really bad history of binge drinking on weekends Definitely less since this news I would say the last few years I averaged a couple beers here and there a few week nights and then like one day of the weekend Covid definitely slowed my drinking down because I have a hard time not drinking in social settings I had a follow up a few weeks ago and they had a student doctor come in and she started asking me questions about my drinking I was very honest She asked me how many times I ve blacked out in the last few years and I started crying because I couldn t answer since it s more than I can remember She then encouraged I look into alcoholics anonymous which caught me off guard I thought this was just a follow up appointment to pat me on the back for losing lbs since my last appointment The doctor eventually came in and had a real tough love conversation with me telling me I need to stop for my health and because I m going to become a dad in about a month She said my fatty liver was likely the type caused by alcohol I left wondering if doctors recommend AA for anyone who admits to drinking regularly or if it was because I m going to be a dad My liver numbers have gone down so I also have been wondering if the fatty liver was the doctor being dramatic She did say it was not severe My partner was shocked when I told her what the doctor said about AA Obviously being pregnant she doesn t drink but she s never been a big drinker either My best friend also told me I m not an alcoholic but I would say she s part of the problem because I can t remember the last time I ve hung out with friends and not drank I haven t told friends and I ve had a few social outings where I was drinking since that appointment Labor weekend I tried to replace the beers with an edible but I still ended up drinking When I drank I asked friends that were leaving to take all my beer and they said we ll just come drink and watch football soon I don t know what to do I don t know if I should stop all together Should I attend a meeting I feel like I want to make a change before becoming a dad Sorry for rambling My mind was racing and I m shaking while writing this I don t know what I m looking for ,Not Sure Where to Start,1

1062,I suppose admitting it is the first step I m and I ve been drinking off and on since about middle school I ve had my fair share of issues in what brought me to where I am today within the consistency of my current daily binge drinking but it started out as my pallet for beer grew I m not one for hard liquor but I d drink that too if I really feel like I need to get my head change going It s not been consistent in which I drink up to a pack a day for about a couple months now there used to be days I wouldn t drink at all but now my thoughts are wondering when I m going to grab a beer when I ve yet to have one that s where things became kind of alarming to me I feel like there s no where I can talk about this without making my girlfriend nervous or even my family which I don t speak to so often and are chaotic drinkers themselves therefore they cannot practice what they preach It s come to a point where I have to say this somewhere to someone in order for me to get over my struggle of wanting to drink out of stress pleasure and the pallet cleanse of triple IPA s Thanks to whoever will take the time to read this ,I m slowly starting to realize I am an alcoholic ,1

1068,I ve been reading some of the threads and it seems like there is a lot of discussion about CBD for anxiety and some about pain but not a lot on sleep So I thought I would post I have narcolepsy and I ve been waking a lot during the night recently plus I m getting older which doesn t help This is typical of narcolepsy and just adds to the problem of not getting any slow wave sleep Quick lesson on narcolepsy narcoleptics spend little to no time in slow wave which is the restorative sleep you need That s why most of us are tired literally all the time I m thinking about trying CBD at bedtime because I have read that it is beneficial for narcoleptics But well it s CBD and I know it s controversial I will talk to my sponsor and close friends in the program as well as my psychiatrist In my mind it is probably a better choice than ambien and other sleep aids Also going to post this in the narcolepsy sub Thanks so much to anyone who can share their experience ,Anyone here use CBD for sleep ,1

1070,So as part of my job I am required to move around project sites I spent long years on one particular job site and it became a very toxic environment for me My health deteriorated and my spiral into alcoholism was deep and painful Coupled with a new baby in the house I finally lost my way just over years ago and my mental health and extensive drinking made me reach my bottom I reached out to a fellow member and he took me into AA and years later th Sept was my years I am still clean and sober and my mental health is vastly improved Then recently I was asked to head back to that project site to help dig the Company out of a hole I ve fast tracked in my career in the last years being away from the booze and now head up our Companies sector that this project falls under So when I was asked it wasn t much of a choice I have the most experience and I know the project But I made it clear I couldn t do full time knowing that it had the potential to not be a good place for me mentally A couple days a week max as I have other things running alongside which I want to concentrate on However to start with they needed me full time As a colleague is away for weeks I am now a week in and I cannot tell you how much of a trigger this place has been for me It s like stepping back in time Like I never left and my mental health has begun to already feel the anguish this place has associated to it for me The memories of the things I did and the countless lunchtimes and nights spent drinking my pain away in the local hotel bars being days away from losing my family I don t feel like I want to drink I know where that leads But the triggers feel so real and powerful that it does scare me what could unfold I guess I m looking for a way to compartmentalise the past period spent here vs now How do I make it a different beast so that it doesn t lead me into a similar path Getting off the project now isn t an option I m months away from getting my shot at Director so this is partially political so I have to suck it up Just worried it has the potential to damage everything I ve worked for these last years Albeit I know it s just another test sent my way of which I must overcome Just wondered if anyone had experienced similar and any methods they used to separate the history from the reality Thanks all ,Back in a working situation that was a huge trigger for me in the past how do I now move past that trigger years later ,1
1071,Hello everybody I was somewhat wondering if this was the right place to post I would never call myself an alcoholic but I did have a period in my life years ago where I was self medicating at work Basically when going out for lunch with co workers I would have a sip of whisky or vodka to be relaxed Basically social situations made me really anxious Had about shots So I was never really hung over and I could easily keep working Didn t harm anybody and nothing Didn t really impair my ability to function at work slithgly maybe I m currently in therapy and try to adress the root causes of my problems which seem to have to do with shame social anxiety as I mentioned and a strong inferiority complex and I guess a lack of validation from my father when I was a child amp teenager parents fighting a lot I was bullied etc Now I know drinking at work is not strictly forbidden in some countries like the US but in my country it is forbidden and there is a chance I would have lost my job if somebody found out Now I have all this old shame and incredible guilt coming up as well as this strong feeling in my body that I have to hide something from my co workers from my parents They don t know and they never will because it would only drive my shame inferiority feelings even higher I thought I forgave myself but it seems my nervous system thinks otherwise I have just had a lot of dreams from back then come up where I was trying to keep my secret trying to hide trying to keep people from seeing what I did there My question Do you have any recommendations how to deal with this very strong feelings of shame and guilt about what I did It feels like I did something really bad It feels like this feeling of having to hide something is still locked in my body I feel like I have to wear a mask whenever I see co workers Ofc it doesn t help that it s shame which started all this It feels like a vicious cycle Any ideas Thx a lot ,How to deal with shame guilt around alcohol abuse at work ,1

1075,Over the last years after a serious breakup I have drank almost every single day just to be able to go to bed because the stress has kept me awake at night and I honestly have not found anything better that helps me sleep Tonight was really the kicker my girlfriend asked me why I was buying another bottle when I had just bought one earlier this week Then she commented I had already killed had of it and I replied oh it s prolly only a third this was hours ago and I m definitely over half the bottle now and still can t sleep I think it honestly stems from when my ex made the comment I didn t last very long in bed and honestly without drinking I most likely do have pre mature ejaculation but it seriously fucked my head up so much I started drinking so often that it really soured the relationship that I honestly thought was gonna last for a long time Coming to terms with all that I realize it was honestly toxic but I ve kept up the drinking and I honestly feel like it s at a point where it may affect my current relationship and I have no idea how to stop it I can buy a bottle every other day and put it down like it s water and I just wrote it off like hey it s gonna help me sleep tonight but it s so ingrained in my head because me entire family is full of alcoholics it just feels like a natural response like taking a breath I know it s not a normal behavior but my brain also tells me it s not a serious thing even though I know it s not Do you guys have any advice on how to get out of this vicious cycle I honestly feel like I m losing my mind every day I go to work for days a week and if I realize I can t drink when I get home I go and get a bottle and the Drink half of it when I get home and I know this shot is not heathy I just can t seem to break the cycle Any advice is much appreciated ,I can t have normal relationships or even come home and function after work without a drink anymore ,1

1089, more months Gonna throw it away tonight Doesn t make a fucking difference I can t stop myself from relapsing Longest I ve gone is a year Didn t make a fucking difference anyway What s the fucking point of staying sober when it only makes things worse Still suicidal fucking either way Still feel angry and depressed and all that shit Still never feel an ounce of fucking joy or contentment or even just feel ok for five fucking minutes Therapy medication none of it does a fucking thing Not when I m drinking and not when I m sober And if everything fucking sucks either way why not drink At least it makes me more numb to it all Serves as a distraction from planning my own fucking suicide every second of the day It doesn t get better It doesn t matter I ve just got poison running through my veins like black tar Only inheritance I ll see from the piece of shit who had the gall to call himself my dad Realise now it s not the alcohol he was addicted to It was the sadness The anger The fucking blind rage The abyss The void The fucking poison that eats you from the inside out cause deep down you know you deserve it even learn to like it Its comfortable in the most uncaring sorta way Doesn t make what he did any better But no one seems to be able to tell me how to break that addiction It s incurable Terminal ,How the hell do you avoid relapsing when nothing gets better or easier ,1

1094,I do care for her deeply but I am insecure in my shares shss unbiased and invested She doesn t allow her emotions to run her guidance and she allows me to create an entire program of my own and encourages my thoughts and ideas She is an incredible blessing to my life That being said I feel like she s become very busy with school work and dating I am really needing support right now and she just seems to busy to be bothered I did call her out on this a week ago but I feel my reaching out still isn t quite being met I do not want to be selfish of emotional I am aware that my program is my responsibility but I would really like to voice my accountability right now on my th step and I feel really unmotivated moving forward without feedback Her opinion is important to me and I love that our relationship is NOT codependent as most of the relationships in my waking life are and I see my moral defects much more spritly in those bonds My worry is if I express this again it will seem codependent annoying or defensive I have been eyeing the idea of piecing some program and step related things together with other women from different groups I am worried though that my tendency to seek codependency is just me looking for an excuse to also loosen my effort and find someone I can manipulate into telling me how to work my program rather than encouraging me to do the steps as she does I do feel very valid that my struggle is not being met and that I am frustrated I am really trying to measure a healthy answer here I know firing her probably is not the correct answer but the idea of creating a commotion because I am not getting the attentiveness I d like seems so very much like making an ass of my skills and tool that I m supposed to have learned to navigate independently by now I am insecure in our relationship right now I feel like if I express it a second time it might push her away farther because I m being self important Am I acting of self importance I really really don t know what to do guys ,Thinking of firing my sponsor,1
1095,Hello I am looking for advice regarding persistent symptoms as a result of a single binge drinking session I had alone the other night I want to know whether it is likely or unlikely in your estimate that I received neurological damage due to an alcohol overdose from an event of which I will outline for you Facts about me years old skinny fast metabolism non drinker very rarely I have binge drunk before maybe a couple of years ago and have not received any persistent impairment before excluding a temporary hangover Incident This took place on Monday th September The persistent nature of the symptoms has urged me to consult Reddit It has been nearly a whole week since the drinking binge I drunk around five coffee mugs only ths full of vodka over a hour period Then I fell asleep I am pretty sure I did not pass out and slept for around hours I usually sleep only hours per night NOTE I had eaten earlier but sparsely Also I did not hydrate with water during drinking the vodka obviously whilst sleeping Results So it must be noted that I have had pretty severe and persistent mental illnesses for many years Of late I have been particularly dissociative potentially delusional so please factor this into your advice decision whether or not I could have received more than temporary neurological damage from the single binge drinking night Consequently the potentiality exists that as my mental illness has been more extreme of late I am psychosomatically imposing the symptoms which I will outline for you That is they may be psychological rather than neurological Or they may be a bit of both So what are the symptoms Well and this is where the potential for self delusion comes in as I am pretty sure one cannot feel the exact region of neurological damage as the brain has no nerve receptors I am experiencing a strange tingling emptiness in the left side of my brain Only the left side however I noticed the feeling only after I got through the hangover which last but a day Then upon self analysis I realised that my inner dialogue personality feels much more muted dull So here ultimately are my symptoms Strange tingly empty sensation persistent in the left side of my brain Only the left side It feels as if I can feel the damage the now vacuous place where once were healthy brain cells Muted dulled personality inner mental activity HOWEVER I COMPLETELY ACCEPT THIS WHOLE ORDEAL MAY BE SELF WILLED I DID NOT EVEN DRINK A WHOLE BOTTLE OF VODKA ONLY MUGS WHICH WERE ONLY THS FULL YET THIS IS STILL WAY OVER THE INTERNATIONALLY ADVISED LIMIT FOR ALL PEOPLE ALL AGES ALSO THIS WAS ONE OCCASION I HAVE NOT DONE THIS LONG TERM I DRINK VERY RARELY THIS WAS ONE BIG MISTAKE So is it likely unlikely that I damaged my brain If the symptoms persist I will be consulting a doctor However I am also afraid that it may be self willed As I said I have been suffering with more mental health psychological recently So I don t trust myself to accurately assay the symptoms I am feeling and whether whether not they are a result of my single hour alcohol binge ,PLEASE HELP The Potential Damage I Received To My Brain By One Binge Drinking Session,1
1096, I ll admit a few times in the past when I was trying to quit I drank again just because I was attached to my wine glasses I know that sounds absolutely nuts but it s the truth I have two sets of expensive wine glasses and for awhile I was known for carrying a glass of red wine to social events with me as an accessory I have oz growlers too What are some things you did with your alcohol specific glassware Been trying to think of ways to repurpose them in some way but I feel tense every time I think about it IWNDWYT,What did you do with all your wine glasses growlers ect ,1
1097,I just sat on a step call I have just over one year sober and I went with a gentleman that has years I barely know the gentleman except seeing him at a few meetings I was suggested to assist by a mutual acquaintance amp x B We met with a gentleman that was not so much intoxicated but rather was drinking to prevent DT s He appeared of the hopeless variety as described in the book Alcoholics Anonymous This gentleman said he has short bouts of sobriety followed by longer bouts of daily drinking non stop drinking He said God isn t real That no God would save him That he was happy it worked for us but that it would never work for him My thought as a man with year clean was that if he doesn t want it we can t force it My partner the gentleman with years didn t flinch As our drunk friend wallowed Mr years all of a sudden just said he s done with the bullshit Let me ask you some questions What I experienced next is I can only describe as an intense spiritual experience amp x B Mr years asks When you drink do you have the inability to stop when you plan on stopping The man replies Yes Mr years ok so that by definition means your an alcoholic Do you accept that The man replies Yes He s crying by now Mr years Do you believe that if a power that was greater than you existed that it could restore you The man replies I don t believe in God Mr years I didn t ask if you believe in God I asked if there was a God do you believe that it whatever the fuck you want it to be that it could restore you to sanity as it has myself and this man Me The man replies Yea I guess Mr years Ok that s good enough Now get on your knees You re going to pray with me I want you to say these EXACT words as I say them He then recites the rd step prayer sentence at a time so that the man can reply At this point is where it happened I don t care what anyone thinks The mans face went from white to color like the blood came back I felt willingness in him from him I was out of my body as I sat observing all of this Mr years pulls out a notebook Ok here s a notebook and a pen I want you to make lines going up and down Now we work up to down not across obviously he s beginning to do the th step amp x B Now after this point details don t matter Mr years showed him the basics of a th step he told this helpless man that he was coming over in hours to check on him blah blah blah amp x B BUT THIS IS THE POINT OF THE POST I have never experienced someone just trudge through the first steps I guess just steps because the man didn t actually write an inventory in minutes let alone with someone still smelling of alcohol After I asked Mr years Do you do this with everyone Mr years replied No only to people that are about to drink when I leave And it s never not worked We had some discussions and Mr years shared what he believed was the truth AA is currently a mockery of what Bill and Bob created Anyone that doesn t do the steps as suggested in the Big Book is not doing AA They are doing something but not AA The steps are the only program of recovery according to the Big Book and a spiritual awakening is the only result of working the steps Bill W And Dr Bob S Would roll in their graves if they saw what AA has become In the chapter Bills Story Bill goes through the steps not yet steps with Ebby by meeting with Ebby times Bills house bills house hospital Bill instantly then carries his message In the story He Sold Himself Short page of the th edition of Alcoholics Anonymous the narrator Earl T describes meeting Dr Bob in Akron where Dr Bob takes him through the Six Step program still not the steps that we know in three or four hours My revelation which might not be a revelation is that AA as we know it has diverged from what it was I believe that success in AA has dwindled from at the Akron Group to approximately in general because there is an emphasis on slogans easy does it one day at a time and meetings which was never the intention The original intention was to find a drunk push him through the steps as quick as possible and send him out to save others We don t see this I hear old timers that if I didn t know better were newcomers from the content of their shares I hear someone with years say meetings meetings meetings and then goes on for minutes taking other peoples inventory I don t hear Experience Strength and Hope I hear I m sober months and am still working on my th step which to me sounds like an easier softer way And it s no body s fault They were taught this by their sponsor who learned it from their sponsor But its killing people Seriously I was years sober taking my time as my sponsor suggeested cut back to meeting a week where I aired my grievances AND ALL I WANTED WAS TO PUT A GUN IN MY MOUTH I now realize Why I wasn t practicing the principles in all my affairs and I was taught not to What we take as AA is really just group therapy People talking about their day No hope No commitment to share the gift with the newcomer Just a friendly Keep Coming Back Or Just don t drink I m sorry I suffer form a disease that is trying to kill me It either wants me to die by the bottle or by the gun Am I crazy Am I the only one that sees this well and apparently Mr years ,AA is not AA,1

1118,Archaic shame based model serves only to make sick people sicker No qualified staff with the only requirement to work here being have graduated yourself Constant victim shaming mistreatment and mishandling of residents due to lack of trained specialists no doctors or psychologists anywhere near here Ran like an interagation camp that intends to break you in order to retrieve information by overworking you and not allowing for adequate amounts of sleep Self fulfilling if you forget something you get titled a liar quick to pigeonhole all addicts as terrible people despite their background and real character traits Stay far away from here No evidence to support the structure other than the few who stick around after the staff here manages to isolate you from your loved ones I wouldn t recommend this place to my worst enemy pure trauma bonding How to develop OCD in months I am a college graduate with a bachlors degree in psychology While this is not much it is much more than anyone managing this program has to offer I fully believe that a program like this should not be used under ANY circumstances The few times that it does succeed does not justify the hundreds of other times that lead to extensive trauma and or death of the addict upon leaving this program Failure to thrive in this setting for a highly impressionable young adult and addict leads to unbearable feelings of failure and guilt which in most cases results in certain death The program wants to believe that this is due to the nature of the addict but realistically relapse related death occurs at a higher frequency when compared to other rehab facilities Below I will illustrate the core mechanics of the program to the best of my ability The core of the program relies on doing daily chores This involves a revolving weekly chore list Typically you receive two or three chores Failure to master a chore based on the mercy of the house manager leads to repeating the chore or having to do more of the chore All mistakes lead to extensive repetition in hopes that doing more of the thing you hate will make you better at it Each chore takes to hours to complete The chores are exensive to the point of being gratuitous Upon the completion of a chore you call for the house leader who then checks off the chore systematically Did someone walk through and cause a peice of dust to fly into the floor where you just mopped Missed a spot drying dishes Did the house leader find a spot that a speck of dust was not removed Leave a smudge of windex That s a ding If you get three dings on a chore that s a strike This is the next core mechanic that is the strike system Anything the manager deems to be incorrect can result in a strike Not following through defending yourself during dinner talking at what the manager deems to be the wrong time people pleasing are all examples of what can lead to a strike You are expected to get a fair amount of these Strikes gain interest depending on how many times the offense or mistake is made The next mechanic and core component of this program are words Strikes result in words that increase depending on frequency of occurrence These words are a numerical amount that you must write on a subject that the essay monitor a separate chore decides Still the topics are random and come from the group itself or Google searches The next core mechanic is solutions Accruing words or more on any one strike leads to being put on solutions here you cannot speak to anyone else but the house leader about program related topics fidget or bop your head or stare at the TV for too long If you perceive that you have been accidently touched by someone on solutions you must say solutions or be on it Cover pulls are another core mechanic in where you must once daily correct someone s behavior This happens in the moment and then must be written down in the form of a reality check which is a positive and negative about people in the house This almost always leads to additional strikes ,Has anyone heard of a rehab like this Awakening Recover Los Angelo s California Beverly Hills,1

1120,I generally go through periods of sobriety followed by drunken debauchery I ll be sober for a week and then drink feel horrible disconnected sick etc Leave booze alone for a bit only to repeat the process over and over and over again The mental gymnastics my mind will play is staggering after or days without drinking Last weekend I was snorting lines of coke drinking tequila up for days straight The mental anguish drove me to put the drink down once more I ve been sober for days now and this is usually when my endorphins have rehabilitate enough to start with their antics for drink On my way home I told myself that I was gonna drink but before I did I called someone from AA and talked on the phone This is the first time I ve reached out in the moment of desire rather than the aftermath of shame My friend from AA basically told me what I needed to hear I m home now drinking sparkling water enjoying the fact that what ever craving I might have had will be gone in the morning And the shame that I would have had won t be there It s when nightfall arrives is when the demons come out During the day I m fine it s something I m starting to figure out I ve read something about the correlation between during the time of day and the desire to use I m just happy to be here one more day sober It may not be shit in the long run but it means a lot knowing I took a different approach this time And that I m starting to get a handle on how my brain tries to control manipulate and trick me into using I ve begun to say to myself If you wanna be unhappy drink If you wanna be happy don t Simplifying it like that has made it a lot easier to digest Thanks for reading and God bless you all ,Finally overcame a small feat ,1
1121,I m exhausted , year,1
1122,i have always struggled with controlling myself around alcohol and drugs my family members have always struggled with addiction and i feel like it casts a shadow on my problems i started drinking when i was and i always drank until i blacked out when i had access to alcohol it never seemed to affect my life from the outside because i was always supported financially and it seemed that i was doing everything that i was supposed to i feel like i m not a good fit for aa because i have never hit a rock bottom does anyone have any suggestions for moving forward with sobriety ,i don t feel like i deserve to call myself an alcoholic,1
1123, Alcohol has caused my kin and I an immeasurable amount of pain and suffering even now I am haunted by the transforming shadows of forgotten deeds that I will never truly know I will forever be the villain in the stories of so many and from what I hear for good cause I ve spent a great deal of time attempting to lay these demons to rest so that I may live a happy and fulfilling life Even now a voice freshly buried attempts to crawl to the surface as it screams and beckons to me It wants nothing more then for me to give in to its acrimony of compunction that has long lost any sense of purpose Evasive it is that to simply name it invokes a primoradial sense of discomfort Say hello to the monster in your closet shame I never realized until much later just how much time and energy I d spent avoiding this simple yet caustic emotion I think about how much shame and embarrassment contributed to me returning to the behavior that masqueraded so cleverly as the answer Now I come to find that this perceived solution was the convoluted function of a variable in a very long equation Now using the lens of newly acquired knowledge and through the power of hindsight I am able to finally locate the nexus of my addiction At some point I felt such an overwhelming amount of shame that I deemed myself a complete failure I d simply used too much white out and it was no longer hiding my mistakes At least not in a way I found satisfactory I wanted to hide the mistakes but it wasn t for anyone else I wanted to forget what I really wanted was to throw the whole paper away The white out via black out method I had employed only worked so long as I overwrote my saved data with even worse data What was more was that it only allowed me to feel okay while engaging in the behavior I simply couldn t cope with the silliest mistakes due to my now well understood insecure attachment style and anxiety Later in life I would find myself very lonely just fired out of a dream job I really believed I had no future prospects I was desperate for company and knew that knowing what I knew about myself there was no way that was going to happen sober I was getting trashed daily in an attempt to form a meaningful relationship with a woman typical behavior for me I had no standards and asked a random girl online if she wanted to hang out We met she was physically deeply flawed particularly in the dental category Still what she lacked in teeth she made up for with other features and personality I d tell myself She had a big house a ton of money a big tv she was a chef had a dog this was perfect I will never need a job I probably couldn t get and keep one anyway I d tell myself I ll just pretend to like her for a while get free shit then I figured it would die down Still despite every red flag I threw at her every misdeed she kept moving full steam ahead I kept the lie going I never could be the one to end things I d have to be pretty drunk to trick myself into believing that I was actually enjoying her presence On the matter of sex however I had to be practically blacked out Even now I can only actually recall having sex with her a handful of times During all of this I had the craziest thought why don t I just marry her and keep the lie going forever maybe it will stop being a lie I went against my moral compass I even told my parents that were intensely confused but still supportive as always Anytime they would question the relationship I d simply tell them that I was happy and that I had finally learned to actually love her I never course corrected I only picked up speed as I looked back at the now completely unrecognizable path I had taken yup I was lost alright I was driven purely by ego and pleasure only caring about myself At some point I took on a new identity I embraced all things evil That is who and what I was I am a bad person I said Once I accepted this now fact about myself I was in a freefall I continued to do increasingly worse things as I used my last terrible thing to justify my next No one said anything no one tried to stop me I still had everything and due to not having to see my parents I thought they believed my illusory happy life My health saw steady decline I gained lbs my liver was starting to fail my skin was destroyed by guttate psoriasis I fell into an unspeakable depression this went on for almost years She began to take interest in someone at work I saw it coming from a mile away she d finally had enough I asked my parents to find me a place to live My parents already had a plan I d go to a rehab in California Like a deeply embedded parasite being baited by a raw piece of meat I was afraid I was angry at the world but the thought of smoking weed by the ocean had me on a plane the next day I lost everything in my vicinity even the dog that I had called mine for years I didn t actually have ownership of anything I settled for nothing and in return chose to live a lie so long as the alcohol and drugs kept flowing I was sent to Awakening Recovery in Beverly Hill s California Who knew such a place could exist All of these rules were thrown at me I was already dealing with PAW s and this was my first time trying to get sober Reality hit hard and this brand was particularly cruel I spent days at this facility most of my days were spent in a state of pure horror as I learned about the rules of the house If you even take a step outside of a room without turning a light on that s a strike Strikes mean you have to write words everything had a rule Each time from AM AM you were doing choirs or writing words for missing a spot on the dishes This was in an effort to teach accountability I was stranded in California you were not allowed to talk to your parents I couldn t speak to them unless supervised and would not be given a cell phone or allowed a job for months I could not speak my native tongue with my parents I tried to call my dad in the middle of the night in a panic and was punished for it What was more is I was being told that I was crazy my addiction was talking and my parents said I would not be allowed to return home I d have to become homeless in LA I can still hear the pain in my dads voice as he told me this on the phone I d come to find out they had sent him a packet saying that I would try to go home and that I was being manipulative like I always have been Once my stimulus check hit it was over like a computer being powered on As soon as the decision had been made I was unshackled I took the power back and took the biggest leap of faith in my life I was fairly certain my parents would catch me but I really didn t know this time If you decide to leave this facility they simply make you walk out the door and do not help you find arrangements it s part of the program its why people stay People not only have no where to go but they fear their parents may really abandon them in LA out of all places Knowing I had that stimulus money was enough for me to make the jump even though it wouldn t realistically have covered the cost of making it back I left they do everything they can to start a fight with you before you go insane I saw someone get kicked out by the seniors there every Wednesday the graduates would come and group you Pick out any mistakes you made and tear you apart I kept trying to call my parents they refused to speak to me I found a hostel and really didn t know how much longer I had I just knew for a fact I was never going back to the Awakening sober living I would die before being subjugated to some new forms of punishment that they felt like making up All of this to say my whole time in rehab has all served to teach me how absolutely batshit insane the addiction treatment industry is Eventually I went to another rehab that had its own set of problems experienced a HIPAA violation and abuse of all sorts Still I did have one good counselor that specialized in trauma I am a psychology major so just learning about the therapy was really cool In all I had over six months completely alcohol free That is until I made the conscious decision to drink again I do not want to count time this sounds like the perfect excuse to kill yourself on a relapse plus I still believe that I can drink safely and responsibly AFTER having learned everything that I have mostly on my own My extensive research on addiction all suggests that treatment centers are doing more harm than good along with AA s addiction model as being the most harmful development when it comes to addiction The way that we think about addiction is the problem and it is all painted by an arbitrary singular brush that is the AA hive mind Subsequently treatment centers think this same way The fact of the matter is I made a choice to give up and give in to take advantage of people to hurt and kill even I did this I have a bottle Bacardi sitting in my freezer right now I don t want to drink it I have had it since last Friday I had exactly shots yesterday night Nothing less nothing more That is what separates those of us who can actually beat this thing and those of us that stay sick or unhappy doubting themselves forever with the disease of alcoholism The fact that we can not only talk about Accountability but actually engage in the act We do not accept feelings of shame anymore We accept that we are humans and that we make the wrong choices that we are selfish that we seek pleasure at the cost of others and that humans can be exceptionally cruel but that they can also be amazing resilient compassionate kind caring intelligent and every other good adjective you can think of We don t need sobriety hierarchy or other ridiculous quite frankly intellectually insulting methods of group thinking that takes away the power and the ability to critically think for yourself If sobriety is different for everyone act like it ,What does this mean to you ,1
1124,for context i also have EDNOS anorexia with purging I am about to go into treatment for all of my issues but in the past few days almost every time I burp I vomit up bile especially after I have been drinking Up to an hour and a half after I have eaten and haven t purged I am vomiting up entire undigested bites of food I am wondering if anyone has any experience with this I have vomited blood and had black stool in the past few days I should be admitted soon and will be medically attended soon Thanks ,vomiting when burping,1
1125,I practiced sobriety for months It s been a month and I drink a couple of times a week only having drinks out socially but it s enough to feel cus i guess no tolerance I wake up in the mornings slow and foggy minded I was listening to something today and she mentioned how our purpose to the world and to god is to be of service to others And I don t know how I can do that when I feel groggy the next morning and not level headed I feel something in me whether it s god which I believe is a power within all of us calling me to stop But idk if I m just making a big deal out of nothing I don t even know if I m an alcoholic or someone who just doesn t connect with drinking anymore spiritually And step is all about admitting you are an alcoholic I know i want to be sober today but if I tell myself I m going to abstain completely it feels too limiting But if I dont then it feels like I have no accountability around it So im open to going back to aa but i also don t want to waste anyones time if I m not planning to do this long term Lol I cant why do I make things so complicated Someone please be brutally honest with me TLDR I feel called by god to stop But abstinence feels too limiting but no abstinence feels like there s no accountability around it Not sure I m an alcoholic Can I go to AA and try this Or am I wasting time ,I started drinking a month ago again While no consequences have happened my spirit feels down Like I m not connected to myself ,1
1126,This week I reached my one year mark Alcohol can do some crazy stuff to your mind and it can cause some really deep scars not only to you but to the people who love you I have struggled with staying sober for the years I ve made it to the year mark before twice actually but each time it s followed by a horrible relapse that lasts well as long as I let it Because of my extended periods of sobriety I ve had family members tell me that I don t actually have a problem Some even go as far to say that alcoholism isn t a real disease Yesterday my older brother wanted me to join him for lunch to have some margaritas I told him no thank you I was working but he still told me that he doesn t believe that it s a real thing Oddly enough he visited me in a rehab facility when I was first getting sober almost years ago It s hard to fight the urge especially when drinking is socially acceptable and normal I think the hardest thing is that I feel so alone while getting sober I have to change a lot about myself and the people I invite in my life I have trust issues I don t open up to anyone because I ve been burned before I don t show how much I am actually hurting inside I don t know how to Well I think i m learning too slow and steady progress not perfection Thanks for letting me rant here Have a good hours,one year,1
1127, I like this exert from this story in the Big Book of AA on page gt Ninety days sober cleared my thinking enough to make me realize I d hit bottom If I were to go back to drinking it would be just a matter of time before one of two things happened I d succeed at suicide or I d start the life of the living dead I d seen what the latter looked like and real death was preferable gt gt At this point I surrendered I admitted I was an alcoholic without a clue what to do about it Many of the people around me wanted me to go to treatment but I resisted I didn t want the kids at school to know what was going on If I went to treatment they d all know within a week More importantly I was afraid I was afraid the treatment center would test me and say You re not an alcoholic You re just crazy My heart knew this wasn t true My head took a bit more convincing The thought of having A A taken away from me was terrifying A A was my anchor in a sea of confusion Anything that might pose a threat to my sense of security was quickly thrust away I didn t have anything against treatment centers then nor do I now I simply didn t want to go and I didn t gt gt I did stay sober One summer with people who enjoyed life sober was all it took for me to want sobriety more than I wanted a drink I will not tell you I did everything I was told when I was told how I was told because I didn t Like most people new to the program I set out to find an easier softer way As the Big Book suggests I could not gt gt No one who drank as I did wakes up on the edge of the abyss one morning and says Things look pretty scary I think I d better stop drinking before I fall in I was convinced I could go as far as I wanted and then climb back out when it wasn t fun anymore What happened was I found myself at the bottom of the canyon thinking I d never see the sun again A A didn t pull me out of that hole It did give me the tools to construct a ladder with Twelve Steps Anonymous Alcoholics Anonymous Fourth Edition p Alcoholics Anonymous World Services Inc Kindle Edition ,The Story is Titled My Chance to Live Days Sober ,1

1190,I spent much of my teens and s spiritually searching At one point I lived in a setting similar to a commune where my life was very controlled by fundamentalist religion When I left some of my worst drinking happened because I felt betrayed by the religious concept I had Today I still go to now very well vetted gurus and similar figures because this is a central aspect of the dharmic religious systems I participate in But I keep the experience at arm s length in a way I didn t before And yet this isn t wholly defensive I ve realized that real spirituality has to be a spiritually of one s own understanding And that means spiritual guides can only be that guides What if a guru was very bad to me Before I d assume God wanted to hurt me by giving me a bad guru or worse be more zealous Now I would just go meditate and try to live spiritually without that person God of my own understanding means one no one can take away from me It means spiritual practice no one can own to own me For thousands of years people have prayed meditated journaled and confided in one another No one owns it and anyone tries to it doesn t invalidate the whole thing On the opposite side I ve often wondered if material success is all there is and in dark hours if this makes me just a loser But by comparing the fruits of materialist life and spiritual life I have to perhaps sometimes begrudgingly nod to the power of spiritual life I can barely get by but work with many millionaires because I went into financial services They can be miserable and I can be miserable that I m not miserable in their shoes But at the same time thousands of monks and nuns from all kinds of traditions around the world wake up in intentional poverty and live happily As greed sinks this plan into dire crisis again and again which way is the only way that consistently succeeds And who is happier the loner chasing material ends or the people who are serious in meetings even if they have little to work with themselves Though it s hard to explain why happy are those whose support does not come from their own effort and who help others along the way ,A couple thoughts on what the Third Step means to me ,1
1191,I honestly don t know where I went wrong in my life I have beautiful children who I love SO much but somehow I cannot get myself to stop drinking I drink a bottle of wine every night when they re sleeping and I hate myself so much for it I make sure I don t drink while they re awake but I can t wait for them to fall asleep so I can drink my bottle of wine ,Accepting that I m an alcoholic,1
1192,I quit for a bit then feel lonley anxious or like shit about myself I drink sometimes starting with just a king can for the day I feel great while drinking shitty when I m not and it builds up next thing you know I m on a bended and keep drinking because when I m not my depression and anxiety comes back when I m not drinking anymore but then I m in these ups and downs constantly while drinking and I feel even worse while drinking then I did for the bit I was sober and I think in my head I want to stop but I don t because when I m not drinking I feel worse Then I m in a constant bender and it takes alot for me to get out of it Then I have a few days sober where I feel like life wasent real during the time I was on the bender and my memories all hazy and il just cry constantly and just feel crazy anxiety this is usually after a week to a month bender Then something triggers it again after a few days to a few weeks this has happened on and off over the last year ever since I left a toxic relationship with my ex gf Iv just shut everything in I deleted all my social media and just have tried focusing on me It s taken me a year to finish a week course because of my constant benders and I have my nd last course on friday I spend everyday alone in my apt and don t really talk to anyone I try and workout as much as I can even on my benders I hit the gym up But eventually I get to anxious on my benders to even go there Im just so bored of everything I haven t worked in years and iv spent the majority of the last year alone I had a few hookups here and there but nothing that really made me feel anything My depression and anxiety is managble without drinking but it s the constant return of it into my life that makes me worse Idk what to do anymore ,My constant cycle that won t go away,1

1194,Hi all I feel heartbroken and my partner and I haven t officially broke it off I really don t know what s going to happen He s been with me since I was still drinking and thinking I had it under control but I certainly did not We were supposed to go camping together and spend nights in the woods no cell reception just ourselves and the wilderness The day we were supposed to go to his parents to pick up the canoe together he decided to go by himself while I was at work because he s not well and needed solitude He texted me this while I was working I started uncontrollably crying Went home after I finished my shift Of course my first thought was I need a drink but as quickly as that thought came in I pushed it out I talked to my friend who s also in AA and I just remained calm about the situation and started analyzing what he was going through Next day went to visit my friend and we did some therapy shopping and ate some food and hung out It was a nice distraction Spent the night and went home the next day He came home the same night as I did only I had already gone to bed before he got home Figured the conversation could wait till the next day We talked and it was everything I thought He wants more space and a studio to work out of Then he brought up how much stress I put him through while drinking He d come home and I d be passed out Sometimes on the couch in awkward positions Or snoring loud in bed He said he d roll me over and what not He also said he was happy I m gunna live now I cried and said I was sorry and that I will not go back I can t I won t I hate alcohol so fucking much It s taken away so much from me Also he thinks that I forced my moving in with him He was the one to bring it up and at the time I was struggling hard financially He said I called him screaming and crying in desperation I was wanting to buy a house with this man and even consider children He said to me if I noticed that he isn t very nice to me He never listens to me we never talk I feel like I do all the cleaning other than laundry and groceries I recently started ordering groceries so he wouldn t have to be the one buying all the groceries all the time Like I ve been really trying I ve also lost about lbs during the past year and a half About lbs since I stopped drinking He also keeps saying he was ready for all those things before but that I wasn t And he was scared we would have a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome if we did But now that isn t even an excuse He asked me if I felt a connection with him I looked him in the eyes and thought about it and honestly said not always We ve had similar conversations in the past but this time I decided to give him space and I am spending a few days at my brothers I feel like I m going to insane with my thoughts Before leaving I just asked him to think about whether he wants a future with me or not I feel like I already know the answer Which is what makes me feel heartbroken And then the question is what do I do next I feel like such a sad person who is destined to be alone I was starting to think I was becoming a better person a better girlfriend Sorry for the rant Iwndwyt,Feeling heartbroken but iwndwyt,1
1195,We were talking about my sister and how worried she is about her And my mom said something to me She said I m not even worried about you these days I m much more worried about your sister Well it sucks that she s worried about my sister but damn did hearing that make me feel good The last thing I ever wanted was for my mother to be constantly worried sick about me but that comes with being an alcoholic You inflict damage on your loved ones It s a relief to hear that the work I ve done on myself has gotten me to a point where I m gaining trust back and people who had written me off have started to believe in me again For the record my sister isn t even doing all that bad she s just been sitting around not working living off unemployment and not showing much ambition trying to find a job money is getting tight and she s got a family depending on her But considering where I ve been the fact that I m not causing her stress and worry is a very good feeling ,Just had a conversation with my mom,1

1202,Hi all I m a year old male kg I ve had a problem with alcohol abuse since maybe but didn t start drinking heavily until end of and So basically what s happened is last year I suffered with severe social anxiety for a long time and I had signed up for a business course at my local polytechnic but had severe social anxiety all the time in class which made it difficult to learn and get on with work because I d be swearing shaking and have to go to the toilet all the time I also had extremely low self esteem But around March covid struck and lock down occurred so I hit the booze for a couple months I was drinking everyday for months more traumatic events occurred throughout the year then around November I ended up loosing quite alot of weight but this wasn t enough to stop me from drinking and around this time I started feeling a bit funny and spaced out weird but didn t see the connection Then around December th I was involved in a car accident and lost my car Then continued to drink dispite this then around January th I woke up one morning AM after a binge on x bottles of bacardi the days prior and from an extremely frightening nightmare I woke up drenched in sweat with derealization memory issues vertigo dizzyness vomiting etc This to me was when my thiamine must have gotten low I chalked it up to alcohol withdrawal But the next day these symptoms were gone I felt slightly off everyday and I kept off alcohol for the next weeks until around February th th Then around February th I had beer Then on February th I had x bottles of wine and beer aswell And I also caught a bad cold at this time Then around February th I woke up one morning and all thr symptoms of the previous time were back and that s when I believe I developed wet brain I went to the ER but failed to tell them about my alcohol use in the past weeks but did tell them about my past heavy drinking for some odd reason and they never thought of it being wernicke korsakoff but since then things have gotten worse So at first I had derealization hypnogogic hallucinations vivid nightmares everynight hypnic jerk diahorrea abdominal pain in right side and a couple other things I also had constant paranoia and OCD tendencies family seemed unfamiliar and faces seemd frightening I also got this extreme fear I was developing schizophrenia These symptoms went on for months until around May June the derealization went away and I started having issues with my memory instead I also felt like I was having mini stroke episodes and went to the ER for them and got x CT scans w o Contrast both were clear I also got my thiamine checked on July th it was above normal And I got a bunch of other tests done they were all clear too But as of now today I still have strange symptoms that resemble that of Wernicke Korsakoff like not being able to remember what I did yesterday this strange wobbly balance feeling when I walk I feel extremely depressed often apathy anhedonia anxiety OCD a bunch of other stuff I have brainfog all the time my memory is all messed up and I have trouble remembering what happened yesterday and this whole year feels like it was yesterday even though its been months pretty much and also I have trouble accessing my long term memorys so my mind just feels blank and I feel spaced out I will know for certain if it is wernicke korsakoff as I have an MRI w contrast coming up later this month and an E E G I have also been taking high dose oral thiamine x per day as well as a plethora of other vitamins daily since July th Throught I also ate a balanced healthy diet too might I add and also took vitamin C daily and oral magnesium in a powder form mixed in with water before bed And I have been clean from alcohol since February th pretty much when all this started I have only drunk on a couple social occasions this year but that s it So how likely is it I have wernicke korsakoff I feel like it may have progressed to wernicke korsakoff around May June although I was taking a multi vitamin since March ,Wernicke Korsakoff Syndrome,1

1208,I thought if I tried counselling I d get it under control I turned up to sessions drunk and eventually stopped going I thought if I for the right diagnosis and right meds I d get it under control I drank on the meds anyway Lockdown took me to whole new levels where im drunk in work zoom calls giving presentations to inspire people while being secretly drunk I ve been getting away with it for years and despite thinking oh she enjoys a drink no one knows how much I depend on it Yesterday I haven t felt so depressed in a long time Nothing in my head can t move and I realise I use alcohol for every single emotional even the good ones when it gets uncomfortable It was okay till it wasn t Now the hangovers leave me so anxious I cant leave the house I cant even go to the shop because if someone talks to me ill take a panic attack unless I drink I have interviews this week and in my younger days I d drink though interviews to perform without fear of a panic attack Yesterday I looked at of these knowing my body is ill I threw up on my sofa the night before and wet myself a few weeks prior Im not even angry at myself anymore but im so tired of trying to carry this on my back along with what everyone else expects of me I couldn t ever see a future without alcohol Not really Today is the first time I ve seen its not coming from a place of bravery but from a place of sudden brutal honesty Im an addict Im an alcoholic I surrender to it because if I don t ill die Really nervous about the meeting One of the things I struggle with is crying in front of people and I just know its going to happen Any tips would be great Normally I don t cry at all like even when I want to Apparently I have adhd ptsd from a violent childhood and docs always put it down to that but every time I think of going to this meeting and accepting what I am its like I cant stop welling up and crying I dont know what that feeling is May e shame maybe grief I just feel so defeated ,First meeting is tomorrow,1

1213,TW I mention abuse Hi Marilyn female alcoholic I just joined this group because I m trying the program for a second time I had over a year sober in but relapsed I never got into step with my sponsor and never really felt like she understood where I was coming from I didn t feel safe or comfortable getting into the real talk She never really gave me the opportunity to and made me feel like a lot of people make me feel Like I overthink and I just need to not do that But I m a deep thinker and passionate feeler This second time around I had a call with her and we laid some good ground work She asked me to write what I will do differently this time around and what I can do I when people bug me a prevention plan I expressed to her that what has kept me sober the last five days is the realization that I could lose my family and friends for good if I drink again I had an ernest talk with my sister prior to my chat with my sponsor and this realization weighs heavy on me Well my sponsor in an attempt to be helpful told me that she could give me one more reason not to drink She said if I drank she would fire me She said it and kind of laughed but I know she was serious I felt like shit after that and I think she said it because of my long relapse period up until now I feel like she doesn t realize how isolated I feel and how nervous I am I am going to end up with no one to turn to The reason why I m here is because now I feel like she s holding my sobriety over me The thought of finding another sponsor is hard for me because I m in such a delicate place right now I m afraid that what she told me was a bit tone deaf I m very aware that I can relapse at any second But I kind of resent her for putting that type of pressure on me It feels a little manipulative Even if it s meant to be for my own good I don t want a sponsor that will just watch me relapse and relapse again But I want one that takes me seriously enough that won t threaten to stop sponsoring me if I were to relapse I m terrified of relapsing But I also want to be true to myself and what I think are good relationships I feel like maybe I offended her because my lapse was so long and I didn t do any step work with her throughout it She s older and sickly and doesn t make meetings anymore just one on one calls with other alcoholics So I know she cares about relationships She is also kind of blunt and a little rough around the edges when it comes to communication I feel like I m too sensitive of a person to do the steps with her For example when we did step one she just had me read a prayer which I meant but I really wanted to talk about why I felt powerless and what my belief in my higher power could look like We also did step two and three read another sentence long prayer She then assigned me step four When I expressed how overwhelming it seemed she talked about it like it was much simpler than it I felt it was But honestly I wasn t ready to go there alone and even now I am afraid to I m also not sure if I feel safe going there with someone who just told me if I fail and I drink she won t do this anymore I guess it s partly that she doesn t trust me and doesn t want me wasting her time But I do my best not to I only ever met with her when I felt ready to do the work But I only met with her twice the year or so I was sober I wasn t ready then And honestly I don t feel ready now I have depression and anxiety symptoms and a history of being abused I thought maybe because she had also been abused we would relate more but now I realize everyone heals differently When I had that talk with my sister recently I realized that she and my brother both kind of blocked their traumas and moved on I have another sister that experienced the same abuse and she processed her trauma a little more like I am By thinking about it and talking about it and confronting our abuser My sponsor never really talked to her abuser she kind of just moved on I have a tendency to overshare because of my deep need for resolution I used to have a counselor through the county behavioral health services but I no longer qualify for a counselor because resources are limited I don t want to re traumatize my sponsor by getting everything out but I feel like I have to really get it out in order to do this right I don t even know what to do because I m so broken I don t want to subject any one person to my mess I really am putting myself out there and I hope you all are kind of you bothered to read my whole post I realize I may just have so many character flaws I should just sit down and shut up but if you feel that is that is the case I hope you all can at least say so kindly I hope you all can maybe offer some clarity I dont want to talk to my sponsor yet because I want to be sure I m coming from an honest place as free from my pride and drinking demons as I can Maybe I just need to see things differently And I hope that I can My convictions can be so strong and I usually try to honor them It s been almost thirty years of people telling me to turn my brain off and stop overthinking ,Having a hard time relating to my sponsor ,1

1215, Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism amp x B Hi My name is Saul Celere and I m an alcoholic I m happy to say that I haven t had a drink since the st of January this year and I m optimistic about my sober future I am also a philosopher and a theoretical physicist My education was heavily scientific and like a lot of people in the modern world I view existence and our Universe logically and scientifically Over the last few decades something of a scientific consensus has been reached concluding that God does not exist not all scientists are atheists but most of them are and if you ask a lot of modern people why they don t believe in God they re likely to tell you that science proves such ideas untrue Until five or six years ago I was a member of this consensus I thought of myself as a atheist I wasn t willing to say with certainty there was no God indeed to make such a claim would require a God like knowledge and understanding of existence and our Universe otherwise you might be wrong But I was pretty much convinced This conviction of atheism prevented me from using the concept of a Higher Power whenever I would try to stop drinking as soon as I heard any talk of a Higher Power I would immediately if privately dismiss it as nonsense But Socrates has been my hero since I was a kid and he said Wisest is he who knows he knows nothing Well thank God for Socrates and my of doubt because five or six years ago I had some scientific insights into the nature of Consciousness that cleaved open this doubt to reveal a new expanded and very optimistic conceptual picture of our Universe and our connection to It Both God and the Human Soul if they exist are conscious entities therefore any new understanding of Consciousness can at any time alter or expand our understanding of God and how we relate to Him Her God is much more than just male The scientific insights I had quickly led me to developing a very new and revolutionary but rigorously scientific conceptual picture of the Universe in which we live and move and have our being This has entailed me writing The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness These principles have general applicability to all conscious systems just like Newton s Principles of Motion can be generally applied to all macroscopic dynamical systems These Principles finally allow us to construct theoretical models of conscious entities and systems such as the human nervous system And maybe more importantly they can also be used to construct the first scientific theoretical models of both The Mind of The Universe read Higher Power God as well as the physical Human Soul These models are the means by which a resolutely scientific mind such as my own can find the concept of a Higher Power a plausible scientific reality And for me finding a Higher Power genuinely and logically and scientifically plausible was absolutely essential to getting sober For the first time in my life I felt like I might be able to trust my Universe that maybe my coming into existence wasn t actually a terrible terrifying mistake maybe I hadn t been born into a cold dead unfeeling uncaring Universe that I was totally separate from Until then I had conceived of my existence as a brief anomaly of personal Consciousness that would be followed inexorably by an eternity of total non existence and in retrospect I see how this conception of my existence undermined me as an inescapably moral and spiritual being But now God had become possible and not just possible but plausible and even more plausible than no God After three decades of atheism this was the hell of a shock An I need to lie down and breathe into a brown paper bag kind of shock And awe lots of awe Awe is quite like fear except it s a good thing thrilling I d been very unhappy for a very long time and I knew that my drinking was making my life worse and damaging my most meaningful relationships But life was meaningless pointless whether I stopped drinking or not whether I wound up with a family and friends or completely alone my own Universe was still going to eternally annihilate me The possibility of a Higher Power suggested the possibility of meaning and hope meaning and hope that wasn t limited to just this one life I was making a mess of So I decided to conduct an experiment an existential experiment an experiment with my own existence in which I was both the scientist and the rat I asked myself If a Higher Power does exist what would He She advise me to do and very importantly what not to do Top of the list was to stop drinking and to really stop And if I managed to stop for a few weeks to stay stopped once I inevitably started whispering sweet nothings to myself about Well we can have one or two just on the weekend with my girl that s ok I can t say the experiment was a success because it s still going on I had thought if I were to ever find God it would mean automatic perennial happiness In reality it has required me to work harder than I ve ever worked in my life But as I keep up the experiment I can t deny that I am happier than I was The happiness is like when we used to roll a small snowball into an enormous snowwheel when we were kids it gets bigger slowly imperceptibly and I have to keep pushing but it s much more pleasant to be a happy Sisyphus halfway up the mountain than a sad Sisyphus motionless at the bottom paralyzed by his own nihilism Faith in a Higher Power made me realise my happiness is intimately related to my morality that I will never be happy as long as I m not making a concerted effort at self improvement an effort that I don t abandon every time I get too stressed or have an argument with my girlfriend The more seriously I take my moral health the better my life becomes Slowly and it s hard and it still regularly shocks me how hard it is if I were to ever meet God and assuming I didn t immediately go for His throat I d say All this the Universe existence the stars Earth the plants and animals Humanity etc it s all amazing but you ve put the emotional psychological difficulty level up way too high Anyway all of this began with me finding God a plausible scientific reality so I wanted to help anyone who is finding it difficult to reconcile a modern scientific understanding of our Universe with faith in a Higher Power Here is a lecture podcast called Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction in which I explain what Principia Theologica is Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans Struggling with Alcoholism and Addiction https youtu be NQJQN D A In the description is a link to episode of around episodes of Principia Theologica in which I outline a rigorously scientific approach to the Higher Power If the picture of our existence painted by the modern interpretation of science depresses or scares you there is great hope and relief to be found in these philosophical ideas and the truth about our physico conscious being Best of luck on your journey Sincelerely Saul C lere ,Introduction to Principia Theologica for Humans

1229,Some of the main reserves of a newly sober person is to avoid AA at all costs because that don t want to become an overly religious nut AA is not a Religious program It s a spiritual one The main problem we drinkers and druggies face is the overwhelming self absorption of our own problems and the need to control everything outside of ourselves in order to fix them When all this fails we begin to feel down on ourselves and turn to the bottle as an escape What AA does is help you look inside yourself to fix the route of all these problems You ll find that when you fix your inner world your outer world will start to come together too This is done in a step map that is easy to follow and has confirmed results What people don t realize is that normal healthy everyday people already unconsciously live by these steps Think of it like wearing a pair of glasses Let s say that everyone in the world has a pair that they see the world through However every time something tragic or traumatic happens to you your glasses smudge What the AA program does is clean your smudged glasses so you can began to see the world others and yourself clearly again If you have any reservations about embarking on this journey because you fear religion and cults then have no fear If your into that then try looking somewhere else Stick to the book it s worked for many and will work for you too if you work it ,For the New comers AA doesn t make you a religious nut it makes you healthy again ,1

1239,I made the decision to stop drinking in the middle of June and haven t looked back Despite struggling every day I have managed to quit for good this time For me the toughest part has not been staying away from drinking but managing the symptoms that I have faced resulting from my drinking I suffered nearly extremely difficult anxiety attacks for at least the first six weeks that I stopped drinking and still suffer from very difficult anxiety symptoms that are debilitating everyday What I believe to be the source of the anxiety is my stomach problems The brain and the gut are interconnected and anxiety and depression symptoms are associated with GI problems For the past nearly days my abdomen is bloated I have burning pain I have difficulty swallowing I belch every few minutes and my stools have been very small and inadequate I do not have gastritis or any structural problems so I do not know what the issue is My best guess is that my digestive system is all messed up and I am holding on to the small hope that it will hopefully go away in the next months ahead or so My question for everyone is has anyone experienced abdominal issues and symptoms recovering from alcoholism that sound similar to mine Has anyone had those issues and or anxiety symptoms If so what helped them go away for you And how long did it take for the symptoms to subside Thank you and everyone struggling know that it is STILL worth the uphill battle Hang in there ,Almost three months sober slow uphill battle,1

1247,I wanted to make a post about this oft repeated phrase and hopefully open some discussion about how others use it I ve been in the programme for weeks now and I ve found this idea extremely helpful Remembering to place my sobriety in front of all other obligations desires has given me perspective on my mental state and the choices I m making I had the presumably common fear the other day of how the fuck am I gonna chat to a girl without drinking which tempted to spiral me back to the bar Taking first things first to mind had me consider if I really want to fall back in the hole and risk death just to have sex The answer unsurprisingly was not yes Anyone else finding first things first helpful or benefitting from similar ideas ,First things first,1

1264,Unfortunately my last stupid decision probably cost my new job and my dream career One decision to drink just a little more ended up getting me in some major trouble and traumatizing me I now have to deal with court in about two months and although it s very minor misdemeanor that will hopefully be dismissed with my attorney the collateral damage and the lasting impact is something I would not wish upon a single soul on this earth I have to stop drinking This is it End of the Line No more chances It s too late to say I was so lucky wow I need to stop because this time I was not lucky And the consequences are severe And I am depressed And I just wanted to reach out to this community and do the responsible correct thing for once and fix myself ,Ruined everything,1
1265,So I hate my sober self Sober me is a socially awkward unconfident excuse of a man who thinks way too much and complains about how his abusive mother and childhood trauma shaped his life for the worse He is also irrational and I hate that guy He is a guy who puts up a semi strong wall and behind that hides a mountain of insecurities that ultimately Ruins his life Drunk me on the other hand turns into a social butterfly who becomes the life of the party Someone who is not afraid to socialise or interact with people Drunk tipsy me also seems to know what to do and knows the right decision even if they don t act on it Drunk me is happier and seems to have no worries or problems where as Drunk me would over think Sober and drunk me can agree on that Drunk me is the better and more confident version of me I wish I had that drunk mentality while sober Does anyone have any advice on how I can achieve this As sober me really need to go away for good but I am worried about becoming an alcohol I tend to drink in situation that bring about stress and anxiety When I drink it s like I unlock a new energy level state I would not be able yo achieve under normal circumstances ,I think I have an alcohol problem that I want to stop before it get serious,1
1266,hi i think i have a drinking problem it started years ago at thirteen i had my first drink it was at a bar in tenerife and it was a couple beers i was petite and young so the alcohol kicked in fast it fucked me up i dont remember anything but the feeling of being messed up felt so good after that i stopped drinking for years because i was scared of alcohol i didnt want to get fucked up again but at i was at a party and i had a sip of vodka and needless to say i went overboard and blacked out i needed it to have fun thats when it began it started with just drinking with friends then with the family then on my own in my room actually i m drinking right now in my room while i write this i drink about shots of vodka times a week i even find myself thinking about drinking if i m sad i do it at night alone in my room it helps me sleep if i dont drink at night i have suicidal thoughts and cant sleep you might be wondering how can you afford all that booze well my dad owns a bar in our backyard i sneak out to it when my parents are out or asleep and take a bottle of vodka my dad bulk buys booze so he doesnt notice i have a stash in my room one bottle lasts me about a four days and when i run out i just make a trip to the bar its either big or go home when i drink i dont have a limit i ll drink until i am literally blacking out choking on my own sick i have mental health issues that have been discussed in therapy went a few years ago because of a family issue but no diagnosis came out of that but pretty sure i have depression and anxiety i dont need a expensive hour for a dickhead to tell me what is obvious anyway i wanna talk to someone about this i dont see many teenager alcholics sidenote i m literally studying science at college have great grades a pretty good friendgroup and good family but i m sick you dont know what people are going through in another persons shoes i seem to have a pretty good life think again ,i m a sixteen year old girl who s an alcoholic no one knows and no one ever will ,1

1277,I am a little conflicted here I ve at one point shared pretty much all the details of trauma or whatever shit that was keeping me drunk using to a counsellor I was comfortable doing so after quite a few sessions with the same person and then I did feel like a weight lift off me Anyway that is all good especially because there s confidentiality and professionalism involved from a legal standpoint Now I ve got a sponsor and I regularly go to groups I want to be brutally rigorously honest all the time but I also like to think I have a decent emotional intelligence but I m stuck on deciding whether I should really tell my story about my rock bottoms Usually I share but it s about the present how I am in recovery At one point I was basically bordering on prostitution which sounds wild to write especially as I am a straight guy but this is something that I dunno if I really wanna share even with just my sponsor or not Part of me though thinks it d be very freeing and probably humorous,Openness holding your cards close to your chest,1
1278,I was prescribed prednisone unsure of spelling for an infection and I suppose I didn t do my due diligence and just took it because I trusted the doctors I haven t really gotten any sleep in like days between the pain of the infection and the prednisone keeping me up I feel like I m not sober right now and u have horrible anxiety from not sleeping and I don t know what to do I need to go to sleep asap because I have to be up early in the morning but I m kinda nuts Please help ,So I m years sober however I ve been given Prednisone ,1
1279,Howdy Gonna try to be brief I m a dude in my late s I have been sober for a week and attended three meetings in total I have done a few AA SMART meetings in the past but was never really serious about it Have known I have a problem for several years but decided to kick the can down the road Recently had a bad night and kinda said enough is enough and realized I need to get this shit under control before I m in my s wishing I had gotten it under control sooner I am not looking to replace my alcoholism with AA I realize people gotta do what they gotta do to stay sober Day Go to a meeting Meet some people chit chat yadda yadda Dude years my junior pulls me aside and starts preaching AA to me Okay cool He s obviously stoked on the program good for him I m still feeling out the program and whether it fits We exchange numbers He tells me to come to a meeting tomorrow as well Really don t want to but fuck it stuff I ve been doing hasn t been helping so why not Day Get a text at noon from this guy gt Call me when you get a chance I m at work and more importantly I do not know you Get another call around Multiple text messages gt Where do you live Do you need a ride End up going to the meeting was decent At the end the guy pulls me aside and starts preaching AA again and how important sponsorship is etc I set some boundaries with I m not looking for that I appreciate the extended offer not looking to attend meetings every day why the fuck am I explaining myself to this guy But he continues on Day More texts and phone calls Blocked End of story Day See him at the meeting exchange pleasantries No big deal End up sitting next to another guy that s about the same age as guy who immediately gives me his phone and tells me to put my number in it Like a fucking idiot I do it Meeting is alright but I notice everyone who shares harps on the importance of a sponsor and how necessary it is to have one At the end of the meeting the new guy approaches me with the same talking points as the first guy Curious to see what tomorrow holds gt Remember when I said I ll try to be brief First things first I m not judging the program off of one overzealous well intentioned person That would be asinine I do not intend to drop meetings because of these interactions I decided to go to meetings of my own volition and I ll stop going to them the same way However I am not looking for a fellowship I am not looking for friends Doesn t mean I m going to be an antisocial asshole at meetings either We re all there for the same reason and there s value in sharing experiences From these meetings though I m noticing a pattern in how into AA everyone is Like people are stoked to the nth degree on the program They say the name Bill with revere Is my addict brain looking for reasons to say fuck AA you don t need that Of course it is I am fully aware of that which is why I m putting forth an effort to attend in spite of those feelings But hot damn it feels like there must be a sponsorship punch card program where you get a free hat or something after you get sponsees or something with the way everyone talks about it In closing Is this normal behavior It s hella off putting and I feel like I m being sold something which immediately raises red flags for me Could just be the group dynamic I don t know I m really looking to use AA as a tool to achieve sobriety not make it part of my identity Sorry for the wall just felt like sharing Cheers ,Does AA have to be a lifestyle ,1
1280,So I had a year alcoholic career Been sober years now I ve been having some medical issues Loss of weight Achy Not COVID I get tested every days Blood test indicated diabetes More tests to be run Any of you heard of alcoholic induced diabetes after a decade of sobriety I eat a healthy diet and exercise Idk Not looking for medical advice Looking for experience strength and hope ,Anyone heard of this ,1

1290,I m finally at a breaking point with drinking I ve been drinking whiskey every day for ish years I want to stop but the only thing I m afraid of is how bad the withdrawal will be I have terrible terrible panic disorder and I m trying to reach out anywhere that will build up some motivation to finally make the move I have panic attacks and severe anxiety most of the time and I have a doctor s appointment tomorrow to talk about that alongside my drinking problem But my panic disorder is making it incredibly difficult to commit to the idea I m horrified of severe symptoms I hear about DTs seizures and hallucinations I want to know how safe I am I need some reassurance I need something to cling to if I m going to go through this I don t expect withdrawal to be easy That s why I m reaching out to my doctor for librium or any other drug that will help the symptoms I am genuinely terrified about dying because of the process I have a year old daughter and the idea of me not being there for her scares the crap out of me Can anyone give me some positive insight Will I make it Is it worth it Should I keep drinking for the sake of my safety I just want to move forward ,Scared to stop,1

1308,My husband is newly sober and coming up on a small sobriety milestone I say small in terms of time passed but it s big for us He s going at it without AA meetings and I worry that without that group support he won t get the same positive reinforcement from collecting chips or openly celebrating these milestones with others Disclaimer I am in AlAnon and I have encouraged him to attend AA but he s really put off by the steps and the Higher Power part It s an ongoing conversation That said I d like to get him a gift or treat to commemorate this milestone since he won t be collecting chips or checking in with anyone But I also worry that doing so would put unnecessary pressure on him I thought I d ask this group if you would appreciate little tokens to mark and reinforce your sobriety or if you feel like something like that coming from a close loved one would put too much pressure on you The last thing I want is to create an environment where if he slips he feels scared to tell me because he doesn t want me to be disappointed in him I just want to show him that I recognize and appreciate all the hard work he s doing ,Sobriety gift ,1

1324,It s been days and it s hard but made harder because my Husband wants his drinking buddy back I was always a closet drinker and worked hard to hide the amount that I drank whereas he drinks everyday but is totally upfront about it and honestly it doesn t change his personality or interfere with work and he doesn t binge like I do did I got tired of waking up and not knowing if I was going to be fighting a hangover or not It s actually great waking up without one We spent last weekend camping with friends and I did fine around the drinking partially because Hubby had others to drink with so he wasn t trying to get me to have a drink with him I haven t told anyone except my Husband that I am an alcoholic he doesn t believe I am and no one seemed to notice or care that I drank seltzer all weekend Is it important to tell people So more questions Is it possible to quit before you hit rock bottom Maybe dodge the DWI ticket or irreparable family issues And is it possible for me to stay sober and stay married to my Husband who I love very much but know that he probably won t ever stop drinking Thanks I m trying to figure this out ,Coming up on a month and my Husband isn t happy about it,1

1336,I can t believe I have made it four days I started abusing alcohol when I was I was depressed and struggling with my sister s untimely death due to suicide It got to the point where my average was drinks a day but I would also constantly drink in excess to that if I wasn t working or felt like calling in for a few days Days like that I d have drinks I weigh lb so yeah My eye opening moment was getting into another HUGE alcohol fueled fight with my fiance who hardly drinks at all I am surprised he stuck around through me getting drunk and arguing with him over stuff that never happened or that doesn t make sense I got beligerantly drunk and argued with him for no reason for five hours He just sat there and let me yell at him because I was so drunk he was afraid for my safety how embarrassing I am a good person down to my core but after a certain point of drinking it s like that part of me shuts off and I turn into an asshole I ve tried to limit my drinking so I don t turn into an angry drunk but I can t just limit my drinks I will keep on drinking until there is nothing left to drink This is the only way for me Cold turkey I would say my withdrawals peaked yesterday and I m finally on the mend I still feel like total garbage and want to drink so I can end the four days of physical torment I ve been dealing with but I m done for good this time I m ready to be healthy again ,Day four ,1

1339,A UNIQUE PROGRAM Alcoholics Anonymous will never have a professional class We have gained some understanding of the ancient words Freely ye have received freely give We have discovered that at the point of professionalism money and spirituality do not mix TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p I believe that Alcoholics Anonymous stands alone in the treatment of alcoholism because it is based solely on the principle of one alcoholic sharing with another alcoholic This is what makes the program unique When I decided that I wanted to stay sober I called a woman who I knew was a sober member of A A and she carried the message of Alcoholics Anonymous to me She received no monetary compensation but rather was paid by staying sober another day herself Today I could ask for no payment other than another day free from alcohol so in that respect I am generously paid for my labor Online Intergroup of Alcoholics Anonymous https aa intergroup org My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist My AA service Gdrive https tinyurl com AAGive Keep ,Daily Reflections Aug ,1

1349,So I was never much for drinking in high school or even college just a little social drinks here and there After I started making good money I got into wine and whiskey started binging them hard every night blackouts that sort of thing After a few months I got smarter about my drinking and my tolerance rose as I learned to keep my intoxication at a certain level Rarely hungover rarely had those ugly gaps of how much did I drink last night Of course after that it started to become the default state not just for evenings but weekends in general then a drink in the morning to loosen up before work then drinking through the work day almost never getting drunk enough to have it pass an enjoyable buzz A drink to unwind to calm the nerves to pass the time bored to make a fun time more fun till now four years in I realised I can t function without it I don t even think I want to be forever alcohol free but I need to break alcohol being a part of my regular life and not just a treat at social encounters for at least a few months but it s like this naked feeling without it already My mind is already trying to make excuses just one every other day and shit like that like I don t feel like I ve been increasingly living in a haze for the past few years I kept joking with friends that I was a functioning alcoholic because by all accounts my life was well functioning good job relationships all well maintained but I feel like I was just gradually losing the plot feeling less motivated more unhealthy and that if I didn t stop I would one day not wake up from this ,Day of ,1
1350,Today actually marks a week since I ve deactivated my instagram with intention to take a week break without caving to reactivate in between IG has long been my social media vice and I ve drawn a lot of inspiration and gratification from it but it has been toxic as well It s where I put my FBI creeper skills to use and endlessly scan things I know are detrimental to my mental health I m pleased with this development and I don t really have the desire to reactive just yet This is the same mindset I want with drinking If you read my other posts you ll see that I plan on at least week break from the bev It s day and I m struggling The last time I took a break from drinking was when I was quarantined from my boyfriend in the same house due to Covid in early May I was diluting my body with water rather than beer and after days of painful boredom I said screw it I m drinking Not because I felt the urge but because I wanted to feel something and occupy time Fast forward to present day and I have chest tightness just from trying to not think about drinking It doesn t seem fair to actively try to do better but still be possessed by this feeling I m constantly reading all of your Day s Day s Day s and I know it s possible I just need to get past the irritable parts On a good note yesterday I went to the plant shop to buy my boyfriend a gift for moving up in his job I ended up getting one for myself as well I think plants add beauty and a sense of duty to a home I actually kind of wanted the plant I got him for myself as a secret way to track my progress in this journey Pothos are those unmistakable vine y green leafed plants you ve probably seen in at least one house growing up They grow very quickly and before you know it you have an elegant cascading decoration that you grew and took care of I wanted to suggest that to anyone that s trying out sobriety and an unconventional way of tracking it If you re curious about what I got myself it makes more sense for my present situation Google fishbone cactus haha ,Progress with a dash of pain,1

1353,I ve been doing really well recently going to meetings one on one therapy and handling my issue with binge drinking I ve been on a weekend away with a friend and enjoyed non alcoholic drinks I went out for my birthday and enjoyed virgin cocktails I was starting to feel very empowered like I wasn t going to really miss out I felt the full support of friends and I was relieved that they weren t treating me any differently We swapped stories about travel plans a passion we all share and a friend asked me if I was interested in joining in on a trip We have travelled together multiple times over years of friendship But when I contacted her to ask about specifics she told me that she d had second thoughts That the trip wasn t for me That she felt like there would be a lot of partying and she felt that I shouldn t come To be honest I felt so heartbroken and ashamed Like a person that couldn t be trusted That was being babied and infantalized Or that I wasn t fun anymore and would ruin their trip because of my sobriety I ve been so low and on the verge of tears all evening Has anyone had a similar experience This is a friend who I trusted enough to talk about my sobriety and I feel like it s been thrown back in my face I feel so pathetic and embarrassed It s been a lonely year and it took a lot for me to accept this invite It s my birthday tomorrow and I just want to hide from everyone Like everyone is judging me To be clear my problem is not a daily thing It is a binging problem so I m fine as long as I don t pick up that first drink I can tolerate people drinking around me perfectly fine I actually like that I can be there for them and drive them home But all my positive feelings about my choice are giving way to shame and I feel so alienated from my friends It s like I m being punished and excluded for making a positive choice for myself one that doesn t impact them at all I just don t get it I haven t responded to the message and I don t think I can I have no words to express how this has made me feel and I m scared of alienating myself further by being honest Any help advice would be appreciated ,Uninvited from trip and feeling pretty low ,1

1360, f The day before yesterday I slipped up and went to the bar and had three beers ordered nachos to go and went home I was a bit eager to get home because I had to my memory a bag of c ke from my last purchase left somewhere near or on my wicker side drawer Standard this is the last time before I take a break or quit internal monologue When I got home I almost already had the zing I was looking for from that bag because I knew I d walk straight to where I last put it and dive in so I could finally be rid of it but it wasn t there I uprooted that general area in disbelief I don t lose bags I managed to breathe and let it go for the night but the addict mentality definitely lingered until the next day I still want it really bad It would have been fairly easy to call the right person up and fork the money out but I didn t and for that I will be proud I don t consider myself addicted to c ke but I ve been pairing it with alcohol for so long it s like best friends not hanging out at their favorite spot anymore so I don t separate them if I don t have to I m typing this all out because this needs to be a part of my online accountability that I ve come to enjoy and look forward to these last couple of days Before that day materialized I was having a slow day at work when a certain celebrity and his wife came in my section to eat I immediately knew who he was and got heart palpitations It was weird that they were there a nice but meager chain restaurant Shortly after sitting down they said they had to leave because their hotel room opened up and politely said bye The rest of the day that excitement turned into wanting a drink I was watching this all happen kind outside myself like whoa dude if there ever was a marker for your personal problem here it is Work is getting slower with the school months and COVID and that makes me worry about money even though I m living with my boyfriend and am not expected to pay anything besides the electric bill I have it good With this extra time there s also a fridge full of beer and white claw beckoning my name in the back room Most of you may say throw it out and that would be wise but it s not even my drink of choice and I m the type of person that likes to leave and be out of my personal space when I drink Hopefully it s not too early in the day to say this but I want to sit with this discomfort and scream back at its face today ,Rage against the beverage,1

1364,And I m just writing it out here at the moment to try to remind myself what it is Because I had this experience once on a farm in that changed a lot of things about how I ve perceived the world around me I realized on my knees in the dirt that the weeds don t come up at random They come up exactly where and when they are supposed to based on heat light wind nutrients potential energy all sorts of shit And just because I can t explain or control it doesn t mean it isn t valid and true It s just true beyond my perceptions And there in that moment as I came to this understanding I an alcoholic could feel the craving to drink lifted from me Because I knew I wasn t the one driving the bus I have a higher power literally everything that isn t me The powers outside I could never hope to understand So I tip my hat to the rest of literal everything or as I call it what God is made out of My higher power is literal everything and I found it in the weeds in ,I have a higher power ,1

1368,i am temporarily living with my parents while i get on my feet financially i really want to quit drinking for good however my parents can t seem to grasp the concept they are m f and all day on the weekend drinkers i do not pass any judgement on them for their consumption habits however they don t seem to understand why i want to quit they are aware that i struggle with my mental health and i have explained that alcohol consumption exacerbates it that it is healthiest for me to put down the bottle for good i tell them this and then the next night at dinner my mom will bring me a glass of wine they seem to think i need a drink for my stress i keep insisting that i have no issue with their drinking but that i need to do what s best for me and yet every night like clockwork i am offered a beverage they ll even buy alcoholic drinks specifically for me when they go to the liquor store this makes me feel guilty and like i should be drinking i don t understand do they want me to drink because then they don t have to question their own habits i could use some moral support and validation that i should not feel guilty for turning down their requests our family environment is very enmeshed which doesn t make this any easier it s like they re offended when i turn down the offer sincerely confused sobriety seeker,trying to quit but family isn t being supportive,1
1369,Hey guys New to reddit even though I ve had this account for a couple years now I don t even know if this is the place to tell my story I just feel like typing and needed somewhere to do it I will sum it up for most part skipping a lot of minor details where to start I grew up in a family of drinkers and I always told myself as a kid I would never drink I turned and needless to say I tried my first drink and got my first buzz it was amazing the next day my father passed away due to heavy drinking for many years I thought I was being punished by god for drinking so I swore it off for good Until of course I turned and the parties started in school I met a girl and we dated for about years until she realized I couldn t hold a job down because I was either too hungover or would just rather party as the years went on I became a party animal I lived off of FOMO Fear of missing out so I would never miss a house party at any cost It got so bad I didn t even graduate high school as I was basically homeless by choice after my father passed away because I just couldn t be at home more years passed and I entered my s going to clubs and bars every weekend and drinking very seldom during the week I met a girl who I dated for about years started dating when we were and again after years of not being able to hold a job longer then a year she had enough and we separated and I was an absolute wreck so of course I went on a bender for about a year but at this point I was still in control of my drinking I could say no if I needed to I was on and off working in the oil patch making good money if you re curious how I could afford to drink so much and I managed to put money away I was quite independent for the most part throughout the years for instance finding my own places to live financing my first vehicle things of that sort basic shit things a normal human being should do Closing in on my th birthday I moved provinces to visit my mother I had moved out of my own place and virtually had no home but staying with her wasn t an issue at all I figured I d figure it out find a new job and get a place well that s where things really started to go down hill I was jobless on unemployment payments and I found myself with nothing to do but go to the gym play video games and drink so that s what I did and life at the time was GREAT I was free and basically feeling like I was on an extended vacation Instead of finding a job I tried to start my own business online and was determined to make it succeed so after drinking more and more steadily day after day burning through my saving I ended up relying on my mother to support my habit This went on for about or so years Single not a care in the world thinking I ll succeed eventually but due to my drinking things as I m sure you guessed it did not go well After years of working my way up from a pack of beer a night to ounces of straight vodka a day I found myself in hospital on my way to my first detox To put it bluntly this also continued for a LONG TIME years I couldn t count how many detox centers I ve been to on both hands easily or more I ve always had the mindset of I don t need rehab I can do this on my own I know I can but I couldn t obviously I finally caved and went to stay with my sister back in the same province I originally came from in hopes of a new life as her and her husband were not drinkers and it worked I reconnected with the most beautiful woman I could ever dream of that I knew from high school beautiful in the sense of inside and out She was independent owned her own home had a great career a dog the whole package WE HAD A BLAST together I m tearing up just thinking about it I HAD HOPE I thought this is it I m gonna start a new life a REAL life one with promise and success BUT I messed up again I started drinking and showed my true self to the first woman I ve loved in years I fell for this girl so hard my mind is spinning just thinking of her my guts turn I got into it so bad that another ambulance was called for me in order to basically keep me alive I had not been able to stop drinking I had consumed so much alcohol doctors were surprised I was alive and of course she left I mean why would she stay not only that but my sister one of the only places I had to live kicked me from her home luckily I had a brother who s spare bedroom I m sitting in right now writing this IM BROKE I ve lost my money including my investments due to taking them out and burning them on drinking I ve lost my home the trust of all my friends siblings and even my mother I don t have a career let alone a job I ve recently come out of ANOTHER detox center and I ve ONCE AGAIN lost the love of my life all by the age of I ve heard of depression and people struggling with it I ve read stories and thought at times I might be depressed throughout my life but no I truly wasn t I was just sad melancholic perhaps I ve always dealt with anxiety but this this feeling of complete emptiness sheer hopelessness staring off into the distance with the thought of will I even wake up in the morning and would it matter I can t even begin to explain the pain in my heart and soul a pain I ve never experienced in my life I m afraid I don t sleep I can t eat I m starting to not even remember things because I m in such a fog of self despair I just I don t even know what to say from here The things I m experiencing are things I ve only ever witnessed in movies Horrors movies anyways this story serves no purpose other then the fact that I just needed to type and feel like I was talking to someone in some sort of weird way I guess If you made it this far thanks for reading and be blessed I hope I make it , STORY I m an alcoholic and I have lost everything Including Hope,1

1372,Hi AA family I hope you all are well and taking care of yourselves During an AA meeting recently I had and I know this is very cheesy a little bit of a burning bush moment regarding a weird experience I had within the first month of being sober I consider my sobriety date to be December but I also remembered within the last week or so a weird time when I attempted to smoke some weed less than a month into being sober I know that that sounds ridiculous but I think I flushed my weed when I first went into outpatient and then I tried to smoke a bunch of ash that had collected where I was storing my weed I didn t get high but I attempted to get high Do I change my sobriety date I don t know how to feel about it I m talking to my sponsor soon but I m also in the middle of a hurricane in my area so it s hard to talk to anyone right now lol I guess I just have a lot of time to think Any guidance of any kind is greatly appreciated ,Do I change my sobriety date because of this ,1
1373,So just had a great weekend at an AA convention and today when we got home my step mom who is in recovery or maybe just sober and not in recovery said to me you don t know shit at days in a condescending way idk what triggered her to say that But anyways I was thinking about it and there are people with less than days who have gotten through the steps and they sponsor people so im just going to cut my step mom out of my life she is not good for my recovery she makes remarks all the time and kind of lords her recovery over mine i just cant handle it anymore and i try not to catch resentments and I dont want to deal with her at all if resentment is in my future with her i feel like she just needs to keep her side of the street clean,My step mom is toxic to my recovery,1

1378,I made an introductory post last night explaining a bit about my situation as well as having slipped on my goal to be sober having made that goal the day prior I m going for a week goal today I realize I should shoot for the moon here but if I want to be accountable I think being realistic isn t a bad first start I m going back to school towards a career in the medical field and having accelerated an already present problem during quarantine eliminating alcohol from my daily diet seems simply undoable now I can t even physically fathom a break anymore I mean I can taste the release of those Trader Joe s bottles as I type this I hate that I have to admit that to myself More than the cravings I want to do THINGS I have wasted literally all of my s being a bar rat The unsuspecting young woman in the corner pushing them back all on her lonesome I want to join a kickboxing class I ve been planning this for weeks and been too absorbed in my feelings and drinks to go forward I want to hike walk trails I ve never done and be in nature it s dry and too hot here but apparently there are hidden gems and I want to excel at school I never wanted to before These are just a few things I d like to accomplish and do but the constant chime of beer o clock rings loud and heavy inside and for what What is all of it but a buzz and the very thing you want to snuff out memories I d like to get to a point in life where I can go long periods of time where I don t drink I d like to be free from these chains and be able to look back at this person I am and see how far I ve come There s a lot of shame and guilt that I ultimately need to talk to a counselor about but for now it ll be whoever listens here I won t drink with you today ,For today,1

1386,Ah where do I begin I guess I can start by saying I feel a bit relieved finding this subreddit Im still new to Reddit and initially started one to use as a confessionary for my thoughts and tumultuous events as what I believe I am an alcoholic Then I found out there s forums for this kind of thing and I definitely binged on all of your stories and the stories in other similar subreddits which I find very helpful I m f and a self diagnosed alcoholic I think the only adult like thing I ve done with this predicament is admit that to myself Gone are the days where an alcoholic is just a middle aged man in a suit and tie drinking Manhattans by am we re different shades and flavors now which honestly is probably more interesting too I live in Las Vegas where this stuff is basically thrown at you literally depending on your profession I m a food server and pre COVID when I worked nights alcohol was practically my bottle of milk cocaine to help stay up and enjoy it more and get home safely I tried switching to daytime but I only evolved in my ways and found more avenues to consume because duh I know I have to edit this to fit the text box which is hard because I have so much to say I know I m going to write here often and try to engage with you all I ve slipped up today after making a serious decision to stop yesterday Absolute textbook self ef f ery if there ever was one haha Anyways thank you ,New here and not so improved,1

1401,So I ve been apart of this community for awhile now and I can t help but consider un joining There seems to be a large number of preachy judgmental people that have presumably been sober for years that seem to intention seek out newcomers and tear them down Not sure if it makes them feel superior because they have years under their belt or what But I feel we have to remember that no matter where we are in our journey we all started exactly the same Whether we re a day sober or years no one should feel superior or inferior to anyone This leads me to my next point I ve seen a lot of people on this Sub comment that AA seems like a cult I don t believe it s a cult and I do plan to go to my first meeting in awhile this Tuesday at my local church But I understand and accept that it s not for everyone If someone is an atheist or just doesn t like the group setting they shouldn t feel pressured to join AA I know tons of people that got sober without AA It s not the one and only solution to sobriety Don t try to shove it down someone s throat if it s just not their cup of tea CONTEXT this has happened three times now and I actually had to block a fellow Redditor for just being a combative argumentative jerk For context I decided to quit drinking on Thursday the th That Sunday I had a massive gallbladder attack very severe pain EASILY that landed me in the E R Turns out a stone was blocking my bile duct and it needed to be removed immediately I had my entire gallbladder removed that Tuesday I was stuck in the hospital for days Due to the covid surge I couldn t even get my own room I was stuck in the E R for days I wasn t allowed visitors My phone died No TV obviously The doctors also talked to me about my alcoholism and detoxed me I was all alone with just my thoughts It very much felt like an inpatient rehab The doctors scared me straight and told me I d have liver cancer and failure in years if I don t stop It was my rock bottom Not to mention my current boyfriend almost left me right before my hospitalization due to my drinking My life was basically threatening to fall apart This just cemented the fact I no longer have a choice I HAVE to quit I ve quit cold turkey before Without rehab I went months without booze when I was pregnant with my daughter who is now going on I probably had the strength to not start up again but sadly I did I went through a lot of trauma with my ex husband and the divorce from hell that caused me to start drinking again I ve quit for months at a time in the past years but this cycle seemed unbreakable I ve been seeing a therapist regularly every other week but to ensure I don t go back to that darkness I plan to go to AA My first meeting is this Tuesday and I even have a friend going with me to hold me accountable But this isn t good enough for some of the snobs on this Sub I ve been asked by THREE different people why I ve waited two weeks to go to a meeting They ve insinuated I m making excuses or I don t really want to quit drinking I even got told by one person that I ll NOT go to this week s meeting and postpone and postpone This is simply not true And out of people backed off when I explained that I just had a MAJOR surgery I ve been given weeks off work actually the doctor added a few more days because I was recovering SLOWER than expected I could not sit up straight or even walk without intense pain up until yesterday I was doped up on various meds which I ve only been able to cut down on in the past couple days I made plans to go to an AA meeting once I PHYSICALLY felt up to it But this one rude guy kept insinuating I was making excuses and not ready to quit Um I ve gone weeks and days without it and I already made plans to go to a meeting this Tuesday based on my physical ability to manage my current pain threshold But I think this guy was projecting or just wanting to argue Clearly these people have never had a major surgery like having an organ removed Like what should I have asked my local church to host the AA meeting in the post op unit of the hospital I don t know It just makes me mad that I m sitting here trying to recover and people are jumping down my throat I m not even allowed to lift my own toddler for another weeks and have temporarily moved back in with my parents for help with her because my boyfriend works crazy hours My parents have been supportive and held me accountable too I voluntarily surrendered my ID to my boyfriend to remove all temptation and my parents have gotten rid of all alcohol in their house as well So I have a strong support system I just don t understand the mindset on here of you need to go to a meeting and you need to go to one NOW NO EXCUSES Like I said I personally do plan on attending a meeting this week and no I m not backing out hence why I found a buddy to keep me accountable I also plan on asking for a sponsor But I can also see why some people don t like the idea of it or consider it to be a cult It s not the end all be all and you can t say every single alcoholic on the planet MUST join AA if they have any hope of quitting It should be respected that it s not everyone s cup of tea and different things work for different people And I certainly don t think I deserved to be attacked because I didn t get off my bedridden butt to attend a meeting even though my pain was so intense I could hardly walk for an entire week and a half ,Unpopular Opinion AA is not the end all be all,1
1402,Before I got sober I hurt my family being drunk often I brought strife onto them pouring on the liquor night after night I didn t give a crap about anybody but myself With nowhere for them to go my hateful disease held them hostage in our home That s was more than years ago Today I m working with a dear friend in very early sobriety Just after returning home from an AA meeting last night their spouse was drunk angry drunk and started throwing furniture onto the lawn They re young child was there and the home was filled with fright It reminded me this hateful disease of alcoholism is still at large Ruining families and breaking the hearts of children It seems hopeless but my own early sobriety had similar challenges Change is hard and scary sometimes for those around us especially a spouse who also drinks I persisted with my AA program regardless of how troubling things got at home going to meetings nearly every day and talking with my sponsor I couldn t solve the problem that my spouse was going to keep drinking sometimes in my face but my Higher Power could I had no idea it was coming About a year into my sobriety my spouse said I m done with drinking and walked away from it We don t fight over nonsense anymore My kids don t say Please stop fighting go to bed Your just saying the same things over and over and it doesn t even make any sense We re still together and it s a happy home on a regular basis I m grateful for the program and for the people here that taught me how to live sober without the crutch of a drink Before AA I believed it as a fact that I could not live without drinking and today it s the entire opposite I could not see living any day with drinking For me alcoholism is just too hateful to those I love ,It s a hateful disease,1
1403,Hi I m looking into going to a meeting for the first time I ve downloaded the AA app so I can see the times locations of meetings around me but I m really nervous cause I have no idea how they work can I just walk in Do I need to speak much I m confused and have no one in my life to ask,First meeting,1
1404, In the face of your own conflicts so not try to drink or dope trying to escape from your own mind because from every undue absence you will return to the damage or needs that you have created in the intimate world in order to heal them It is very common that in the face of emotional pressures we feel as a result of the problems that disturb our peace we seek relief from alcohol and drugs This escape is capable of generating greater damage in our journey which we will be forced to heal under the weight of greater suffering It is necessary to think about the cost benefit ratio The apparent benefits that alcohol and drugs offer anesthetized our Dad and distressed mind for a few minutes so not compensate for the serious physical and spiritual harm that will be generated We will always return with a greater amount of disturbance after the chemical effects of the drink and narcotics cease Furthermore very often the drugged or drink person does things that in good conscience he she would never do bitterly regretting their lack of common sense and sometimes for the rest of his her life We will be better off seeking relief from reliable sources Prayer calms the heart calms the mind produces physical benefits as it relaxes tensions and still allows us divine inspiration to overcome our pains Reading high spiritual works opens the window of the mind and supplies the spirit with renewing ideas changing the psyche for the better The work of helping others link is to the divine currents of love from where we will extract the necessary energies to assess our difficulties We will find peace in prayer in the meditation of divine truths and in the work of love for the others If we do all of this we will be taken by the master to the sky of serenity and we will no longer need to sink into the Hell of drugs or alcohol ,Running away the easy way ,1

1416,So I ve been sober for a few months now and this is from years and years back The relationship was awful the guy had left bruises on me but he taped me and I just saw it and it was terrible I was belittling him and repeating myself and raising my voice and demanding sympathy just horrible behavior I had not idea I was like this when I was drunk I even called a friend who had seen me that way and she was saying that it was bad at the worst part of my drinking but even before I totally stopped it had improved over the years I have PTSD and I m sure that influenced it but I m just shocked What I really want to know is how do I go on after seeing this I can t believe I m the person talking like this How do I live with myself How do I know I m not just secretly a terrible person and the reason I see what I see on the screen is evidence of that ,I just saw a video of myself when I was drinking and it was awful I feel like a really bad person,1
1417,I drank alcohol for twenty two years I had some periods of sobriety using willpower but I only wanted to quit drinking I didn t want to change anything else about my life I used to psych myself up for the mental battle to be sober on the weekends Today I m as calm as I ve ever been I have complete faith that God is going to keep me sober today I don t have anything to worry about The difference is really noticeable I can relax and focus on what I need to do today in a spirit of service I m really grateful for AA and the authentic spiritual teachers throughout history Have a great day everyone ,the difference this time,1
1418,Hey so as the title says I ve told myself I m not doing it I can t get rid of the thoughts today though and they re overwhelming I ve essentially got a free pass where nobody would know I was drinking i could get away with it without issue Times like these are the worst when I m on my own and there s no chance of others knowing I drank I feel like maybe I m not not drinking for others and not myself maybe This happened months ago when I was actively drinking where I partly tried to stop and I almost killed myself in an accidents alone That night for the entire day i had the same feeling The plan was set but I told myself i won t Until it was minutes before the last store closed and I realised I wouldn t be able to buy vodka after that time so I rushed out to get some These situations where I m alone are rare but extremely difficult Any advice would be appreciated if somebody has been in a similar situation,I ve been sober for months now and I ve been meticulously planning how I m going to drink tonight I m aware it s wrong and I ve decided I won t do it but the thought and plans will not leave ,1
1419,I guess I just need somewhere to vent My brother called me at am this morning and was crying said he messed up I knew from the moment I heard him speak that he was fucked up I asked him what happened bc I went to the worst scenario in my head However he said he was outside in the drive way and that he couldn t get up I go outside to find him on his bottom crying He said he thought he broke his leg and I immediately checked his car Nothing was wrong with it I knew he didn t get in a wreck but I was filled with rage on knowing what could have happened to him or someone else I asked him if she drank and drove and he told me no but knew it was a lie bc his car wasn t there when I got home He also has some history of doing it but my mom usually caught him He knows what a DUI or killing someone can do but yet he continues to do it He tried to tell me to just help him to the bed and he ll sleep it off Only for me to see that his ankle was off to the side I told him we had to tell out parents can call because his ankle was broke fractured He started crying bc he knows that him doing this is stressful for my parents since we had an uncle pass away from unaliving himself and my grandpa recently fell and broke his hip I guess I just don t know what to do I m not gonna sit here and find an excuse to why he drinks himself to such a belligerent state Because quite frankly my parents are GREAT parents Anything we ve ever wanted we always had I m frustrated and sad to just see them worry about what he will do in his future He has had everything given to him and he continues to put his entire life a risk Not to mention how he could potentially ruin someone else s life ,My brother constantly drinks and drives,1

1432,Hi all my name is Ali and I m an alcoholic The th of August was my three year sobriety birthday after a year career and all the destruction that comes with it so no need to go into detail I live in Lebanon and we only have one group and as fate would have it it was a minute walk away I went religiously for a year and a half and took up a service position and couldn t believe the changes in me neither could my friends and family So covid happened and I lost my business and all my money that took a huge toll on my marriage which ended last year after we were both affected by a massive explosion that destroyed half Beirut the flat I was in was literally blown up and I walked away with a few stitches Now years ago any one of those would have had me binging for weeks all together I probably would have died of alcohol poisoning And throughout everything two things an old timer always stuck in my head Think it through and if it s totally out of control how is alcohol possibly help So my point is life is random and can be very hard and we have to accept life on lifes terms but as alcoholics that is never ever going to be a solution God bless you all,My story for those who think life changes automatically when you stop sorry for the long post ,1

1440,Hate life Hate being here on this fucking planet Have for as long as I can remember which I guess is why I started drinking all the time doing heaps of drugs and cutting myself Did it help No not really But it did pass the time Made me feel like I could see myself just waiting to die rather than feeling like I was always a month or two away from killing myself But now I ve stopped all that shit Haven t done drugs for about months Haven t self harmed for Haven t had any alcohol for Did it cause it s all you fucking hear as an addict shit like you gotta stop you ll feel so much better and you ll never get where you need to be while you re doing that shit And maybe it s even true in some cases Think the thing people forget is I did that shit because I hate being alive Suicide didn t just feel like it was in the cards it felt like it was the whole fucking deck Like my next draw was it I could delay it but it was fucking inevitable The therapists couldn t help Not DBT or CBT or EMDR or fucking any of them It was all just fucking words at the end of the day I d take the suggestions journaling meditation breathing exercises the fucking mindfulness and practice em I mean really try for at least a month but still sweet fuck all in the results column Pills were the same Antidepressants antipsychotics mood stabilisers didn t fucking matter When through dozens and dozens of the fucking things None of them did anything not a fucking thing Not even one pesky fucking side effects Zilch So then I started self medicating Maybe it s just cause I was so fucking numb all the time I just couldn t tell how much I was suffering but I felt better At least in ways Didn t have relationships to ruin and for sure didn t start new ones but I could at least tolerate talking to people Could tolerate being at work can t do that normally Shame it s hard to go unnoticed doing that shit at work though so I still couldn t hold a job Made a couple things better at least But then I stopped Cause people I used to know told me I should Only they fucked off outta my life and I relapsed Then I stopped again cause those fucking people have instilled their fucking ideas in my head now and I can t escape the fucking guilt and shame anymore and addiction is basically ruined for me Thanks fuckers But now I m worse than ever The medication still doesn t do a fucking thing Therapy is still just fucking useless words Everything still fucking sucks and I still think about killing myself Still exercise everyday eat well try to do shit but it doesn t fucking help one iota And now one of my only options becoming an addict to numb it all away is gone cause of the fucking guilt And the fucking therapists and shit just pat you on the back and tell you how fucking proud you should be for kicking the addictions Like it fucking matters Like them being proud translates to you in any fucking way Like you don t constantly wish you could throw the guilt away and go right back to it Like it s made any fucking difference in your life whatso fucking ever They just act like you made it through hell when in reality you re caught in the worst fucking hell yet And then they dust off their fucking hands and act like the hard works all done at least the bulk of it But it fucking isn t Feels like I ve lost ground like I m a few steps before square one now I just fucking hate this shit I don t understand what my brain is fucking waiting for by not letting my just up and kill myself I don t know why the fuck I can t do it when it s all I wanna do when I don t have any fucking hope and I don t fucking care if it ll get better one day ,Why kicking my addictions doesn t fucking matter,1

1466,I celebrated two months of sobriety this past Monday All the meetings I go to are at the same club at about the same time I ve been going there consistently for almost three months now Because of this I often run into the same people and I ve gotten to know the people at my meetings really well and have already made some good sober friends About a month in I developed a crush on a long time member of the club with over years of sobriety I made a move and we ended up hitting it off instantly We started hooking up every week or so It was great except I found myself becoming a lot more self conscious about my appearance at meetings than I was before we started hooking I got a little too focused on making sure I looked attractive to him at every meeting that it really started to distract me from the purpose of why I was there in the first place Then I started to wonder if other people in the meeting noticed I was trying to put my effort into my appearance and that made me self conscious as well On top of that I am friends with a really beautiful young woman about my age who obviously gets a lot of attention at the club and the guy I ve been talking to has admitted he finds her really attractive They are also good friends and I find myself getting really jealous whenever he s near her or talking to her It s like the feeling of jealousy comes on so quickly and aggressively I can t even process it and I m just instantly seeing red I hate that I feel this way because she s a really sweet girl who s earnestly trying to work the program She s also just going through a lot We should be on the same team supporting each other especially because our sobriety dates are so close and I feel awful about these jealous feelings I just constantly find myself comparing myself to her These feelings got so overwhelming one night I found myself leaving a function early when I saw the two of them sitting together I decided after that point that I needed a break from meetings at that club I promised myself I d keep up with meetings and find other places to go but I ve fallen off severely and I know that s putting my sobriety in danger This club just became a default place and safe space When I didn t know where to go or what to do I went there and could always find someone to talk to Now I m so afraid and anxious to start up meetings there again I ve changed my appearance drastically I shaved the side of my head to support a co worker undergoing a brain surgery and now I m really worried this guy won t find me attractive if he sees me But I also feel like by not going to the meetings I m losing so much of the social support and connections I ve built up over the last few months Not sure what to do Idk if my anxiety will let me show my face at a meeting there for a while I ve been telling myself I ll feel more confident going to a meeting there after I ve lost more pounds I know sounds ridiculous Yes I have a sponsor and she was supportive of my decision to take a break from meetings there but she also really wanted me to stay on top of my meetings if I were to go elsewhere and I haven t to be honest I m only on step I know there s so much I don t know Just looking for a little experience strength and hope in this situation ,Feeling inadequate in meetings,1

1468,A couple years ago I did a lot of things I regret mostly because I was drinking a lot and could barely tell left from right But I never use this as an excuse and rarely as an explanation because I feel so guilty for blaming alcohol but I might as well mention it on here because it is still part of my story Alcohol used to make me angry so so angry I was angry before but it made it worse Because of this I would basically ruin all my friendships and relationships out of revenge for small things they d done to me I got back at them by doing worse And justifying it with I m hurt because of you so I did this I never told them that though because I knew it wasn t good enough That didn t stop me from acting out anyway though Sometimes I wouldn t need a reason to act out I just would and I can t explain my thoughts other times I did have a reason Either way I know I caused damaged consciously or unconsciously I think that those people in my past have moved on from it now but I can t be sure we don t speak anymore Maybe they re still hurting But all I know is that guilt eats me up everyday so much I wake up think about it go on with my day still thinking about it go to sleep still thinking about it It hurts so much I can t forgive myself I don t know why it s so hard to though I ve convinced myself that I m an awful person and I should just die to get rid of this pain My self worth is close to nothing Idk what to do ,How to forgive yourself ,1

1483,You have to trust people to tell them your life isn t going so well You then have to trust those people again and even more so when you tell them your life is doing better Because to do better there must have been bad to begin with To make things better you have to do something positive Everyone here today is having a positive effect on everyone else present Whether you speak or not You are all equally important We are all here for our combined issues with alcohol and through each person speaking through every story shared through every little smile whether seen or unseen we are helping each other heal a little at a time I heard an interesting thing the other day that made me think a little harder than I normally would And it s this Who we are right now often seems to be the most important thing Its not What s important is who we can become As alcoholics we often think selfishly It s always me me me And yet within that me me me mentality there is still a sense of community A community of voices all speaking at once inside our heads Will I have a drink tomorrow Do I have enough money to drink tomorrow Will I go to the shop early or maybe later in the day when the hangover wears off a little Do I buy extra so I don t have to go out again the day after These are all questions I would quietly ask myself every single time I had a few days off between work It was always a conversation to myself No one but me But even as selfish as those thoughts were It was still community that we all have within us A different level of thinking that goes beyond the present and the selfish here and now We all think about tomorrow the day after that next week next month and next year It is hard to say this and I m sure I m not the only one who at one point in time accepted that there would be no tomorrow At some point in life we would be left alone cold and bitter but it would be alright because alcohol would always be there as a companion A companion that can t buy happiness only rent it but it will always be there as a way to climb out of hell Or more honestly to fall deeper into it But thankfully what I have come to realise over the last few months is that ultimately we have control Looking back I often drank because the world around me was too busy too loud too chaotic I grew up too quick and unaware to me I drank to drown out the stress the pain and the hurt that life threw at me And at some point what started as a coping mechanism became an addiction And that addiction rapidly grew into a powerful demon And I gladly called on that demon for over a decade to help deal with lifes struggles And yes my demon and I had fun together It would be a lie if I said it wasn t fun sometimes I could tell you all stories that would make you laugh and smile and the majority all start with a drink But that s the worst part Those stories almost always start with a drink The truth is I had an abusive relationship with the devil that is addiction But at some point all bad relationships face a fork in the road We all have a choice as to where that road leads and I have made my choice I choose to live free and happy Despite a few setbacks and more than a few bumps in the road I am in control of my own destiny Sure I can choose to let this poison that is addiction continue to dominate who I am Or I can fight back for the little community that lives inside me The good selfless side that I ignored for so long The one that tells me to be a little kinder to people despite how they treat me Because maybe they are having a bad day Maybe I can clean up after dinner even though I cooked the meal Maybe the others in my home are too full from my delicious cooking Just maybe somewhere along the line I can help someone else who is struggling along their own road and in doing so maybe my road will be a little easier to walk along I suppose the point I m trying to make is that maybe if we took a little more time to listen to what is going on around us we wouldn t find the world so loud ,I shared this with my online group last night Perhaps it will help someone here ,1
1484,I am a high functioning alcoholic When I m drunk most non alcoholics would never know I m drunk But a few hours later once the acetaldehyde has begun accumulating I feel like I could just drop right into a coma After the acetaldehyde has mostly converted to acetic acid I feel like I m slowly dying but otherwise fine Why does the acetaldehyde phase effect me more severely than the ethanol phase ,hangovers and acetaldehyde,1
1485,I am I have been sober for days now I stopped drinking cold turkey because the last two times that I drank my hands would shake I felt physically sick for a few days after I would drink and my anxiety for the next week or two would be through the roof I felt like something bad was going to happen in a funk panicky it just got to a point where I asked Why do I keep doing this Fuck this So I stopped drinking Initially I thought I would just take a few weeks off from drinking but then weeks turned into months and then the pandemic hit and it made it easier for me to stay home not go out with friends and drink BACK STORY Before I quit drinking my early to mid s I was in college drank a lot partied a lot and looking back I also blacked out a lot A very social drinker I never drank on my own or had cravings for drinks I only drank at parties or social gatherings However when I would drink I found that I would often overdo it When I was young and in college I did not notice how drunk I would get because everyone else seemed to be just as drunk as I was Once I was out of college my drinking slowed down dramatically because I was going out to parties less working full time etc But when I would hang out with friends I would drink in excess Luckily at this point in my life I was a happy drunk I would dance have fun laugh be very outgoing but just really drunk This all changed after my father passed away from cancer in Immediately after he passed away I started dealing with some really bad depression I still wouldn t drink on my own or crave drinks but again when I did make myself get out the house to meet up with family or friends for dinner or drinks I would overdo it but this time id be emotional crying and blacking out just an emotional mess One of those nights included me blacking out at a bar waking up with my head cracked open vomiting all over myself in the hospital and needing stitches to close the gash over my eye Till this day I don t remember what happened And to be honest from to ish maybe even into there are nights that I do not remember at all where there are pictures of me out with people having fun but I have no recollection of those events I think it is a combination of the severe depression along with the alcohol where I just can t seem to remember months at a time Honestly it is all a blur So fast forward to in early July I went out to brunch for a friends birthday This was the first time where I noticed after two drinks my hands began to shake I felt really paranoid and in retrospect I think I was having a panic attack I did not know it at the time but looking back I think thats what it was After this day I took about two weeks off from drinking until my cousins st birthday that we were going to celebrate in Las Vegas First night out I felt fine and happy but after two drinks I immediately black out and cannot remember the rest of the night The next morning my hands were still shaking my anxiety was crippling and I could not leave the hotel room the entire day I went out at night with everyone since it was the last night but I didn t really drink and tried to play it off as best as I could July th was the last time I drank So July I stop drinking cold turkey and figure ill take some time off from drinking I still smoked weed at this point I found it helped with my anxiety helped me sleep at night and it felt good to smoke and listen to music which is one of my passions in life watch movies etc However once the pandemic hit and everything was closing down my only outings twice a month were for groceries and weed One of the days the line at the shop was long and I started thinking if I get COVID from being at this weed shop and I die or someone in my family dies that will be the stupidest shit ever I still bought weed that day but stopped smoking soon after days with no weed So I have been sober from alcohol days and weed days I have gotten used to not drinking in smaller social gatherings since however I have two bachelor parties coming up and two weddings coming up I feel like I am in a way better place with my anxiety and depression I have been considering drinking because I feel like I am in a better place BUT I HAVE SOME DOUBTS amp QUESTIONS I apologize in advance if these questions trigger anyone I do not know where else to go and would appreciate any advice or help My questions How do you know if you re a person that should never touch a drop of alcohol ever again How do I know if I am in a better place only BECAUSE I m sober or if it is my mental health that has improved and I can drink again How can I know how I will react with alcohol if I don t see how I am with it in my improved current mental state amp x B I truly appreciate any of you that read this entire post Thank you ,First time interacting with the AA community I apologize for the long post I have some questions ,1
1486,I m just under a year out from full sobriety for the first time in over years I relapsed just over days ago off alcohol and I m sober that long again So why can t I stop lying I have a sponsor I go to meetings and I do my Steps I lie about little things Like getting coffee or buying something My SO has made it clear because of all the lying I did in my using I m not trustworthy and I understand that I keep being asked why I just can t be honest no matter what I don t know I don t understand I just find myself lying because I don t want to hear the bad and inevitably the bad comes out within a day or two anyways I KNOW this is going to happen and I find myself lying anyways I feel stupid and shamed I really want to quit this pattern It just seems like whatever I do I keep doing it I m aware how stupid that sounds I don t know what else to do ,Can t stop lying,1

1489,Hi I am not an alcoholic but I love drinking in a social setting But recently in the last year or so I have had episodes where I drink too much and lose all memory of certain periods of the night And that s when I become really aggressive and abuse my friends It doesn t happen all the time but whenever it does I would have no memory of it I don t even abuse all my friends but I pick on people in a party and say the most inappropriate things I have tried to moderate my drinking but my body system doesn t give me a signal like I wouldn t even feel slightly sick if I have had a lot of alcohol I never puke as well It never used to be a problem all of this started in I am a really warm and genuine person otherwise I have been told by my friends that I become some other person altogether whenever these episodes happen ,I am not an alcoholic but I do love to drink in social settings However recently there have been episodes where I get hella abusive with my friends after having to drink too much ,1

1491,Hello all So my boyfriend introduced me to his best friend work buddy and his fianc e Mary All four of us are addicts sober dates ranging from two years and up His best friend and Mary have two kids mo and yrs They were able to go to meetings with the oldest but the youngest is a bit more fussy As a stay at home mom she s not able to leave the house much and not able to bring the kids to meetings when the boys go together We all went on a week vacation together and Mary expressed to me she really misses meetings and is hard on her not to be able to go anymore I would really like to offer to come over while the boys are at meetings and maybe do a small meeting with just us Meetings were never really my thing but I gave a good shot and believe that even if it isn t the best option for me that they can be semi helpful The only reason I bring this up is because I have no idea how to run a meeting and do not want to share this suggestion with Mary just to leave her with all the logistics I understand the basic set ups of a meeting and could probably fumble my way through making a schedule where we read passages of the big book and talk about them every week but I would love to have it be more interesting than just reading literature Or if it s just reading is there a better way to set up when what parts of the book to read Any suggestions on additional things we could do read or suggestions on how to break up the big book would be great I am going to be posting this is narcotics anonymous sub and probably be looking to include their literature as well tdlr how do i choose what to do during a two person meeting ,Two person meeting need advice please ,1

1495,Im posting this so maybe it will be some sort of motivation for my future and so I do not go back on what I say for the final time Let me begin by saying that the town I live in does not help neither does my job Both are alcohol related I drank only a few times a year before I moved here and afterwards it became a daily thing which has now come down to weekly with sometimes multiple times per week Last night i went all out because i was off today and the amount and varieties that i drank is absurd I felt horrible this morning and on top of that i decided to cook food at am and left the food in the oven and fell asleep I guess one of my roomates caught it or i drunkenly turned off the oven The dreams where horrible and made me think i was loosing me mind I will no longer convince myself that any hangover is worth it I ve had enough Back in February I was sober for weeks and it was the best I felt financially and mentally in a while I think the hardest part is telling my friends no when they ask to go out simply because i know i ll see them less now that i have quit It s a sacrifice I have to take Thanks for all who read this and any tips or words of encouragement are appreciated ,Trying again,1
1496,Or maybe it s just lockdown I had a really bad blow the other day and I drank a whole bottle of wine As soon as I took the first sips I immediately felt calm relief happy and I realised uh oh a positive memory of relief will fuel addiction I poured it into a water bottle and went for a walk finished the whole thing ended up walking home in the dark I hid it from my housemate I drove to my partners house I had four big swigs of tequila before I went in because i didn t want to be the only one drinking and knew they wouldn t be ate a breath mint and didn t mention I d been drinking or drove there drunk Then I ended up upsetting him that night and bawling my eyes out I m having my first thoughts of Maybe I do need to go to AA am I an alcoholic Thoughts advice ,Maybe I do have a problem ,1

1500,Well on Wednesday and Thursday I got really drunk off Happy Dads and let me tell you I am not happy now I don t remember much since I basically drank all day Thursday Am to pm As well as using cocaine which idk why I had been sober for over months from that Well I ended up calling and cursing at my dad while he was at work In short I cursed him out and insulted him I took a few low blows with my insults apparently I also yelled at my mom and insulted her My dad well me and him have a rollover coaster of a relationship Some days I hate the damn guy other times I feel some sort of pity I don t fucking know I feel sad that he has to deal with me and he works so hard Then I think of how he treats me how he called the police on me and I think that guy isn t your friend look what he did I think of how he forced me through college when I told him early on about how I was robbing and drinking because I already had a drinking problem at Then at times I think I feel sorry for him after all he gives me work I just hate how he speaks about it like he owns me With my mom sometimes I just get so frustrated at how she talks She lives in a make believe land She thinks one day we can all move into a big house and live happily ever after When I already told her I don t even want to eat dinner with them let alone even hear them To make things worse she now records me whenever I m drunk to try and shame me I HATE being recorded I HATE cameras in general I literally don t give a shit about what I did or say especially when I drunk I don t want to remember that crap My ego or just thoughts are just so negative I just even find ways to shit on her cooking Like it s to greasy or hey you are using vegetable oil from the fucking food drive I feel bad but then I hate when she tries to tag team me with my dad She tries to make me feel bad Today in our AA meeting we discussed the th step I have hurt my family a lot with my drinking So I tried to apologize Me and my dad haven t spoke since Thursday He started to cry and said I hurt him emotionally after I tried to apologize Well I didn t feel a tad bit bad honestly I just said this fucking guy In short it turned into a hour long conversation and he said he didn t have no hard feelings towards me but that he was done with me Part of me is relived because I am done with him as well thankfully I have a good job lined up I don t need him I ask myself as I recover Does he really care He didn t even say happy birthday last Sunday Is he acting to try to make me feel bad Is he REALLY done with me Is he good or bad friend for that I also think fuck these guys mom amp dad I can t wait until January so I can move out block them and never speak to them again The th step talks about from my understanding identifying who you hurt and being willing to repair those damages I did my family the worst but I am not ready practice forgiveness real forgiveness to them and myself I still have some built up negative emotion towards them and I need to analyze where it came from and how to get rid of it I don t speak at my meetings but that is what I had built up inside of me as I heard others speak I never want to hurt them but like I said I need to analyze my emotions and hope that I m due time our relationship betters The road to recovery is long but like today just for tomorrow I won t drink Happy hours guys Thanks for reading my post ,Just want to vent,1
1501,So my story is that I started drinking a lot in college and I left with some lingering chronic health issues that I believe are from the drinking However clearly most people who drink as much as I did don t get the same health effects so there might be some underlying reason it happened to me Or perhaps i ll learn that it s more common than I know Here are my symptoms that won t go away GERD I have severe acid reflux I take prilosec daily If I eat certain foods or too much food I will get a lot of acid reflux and want to throw it up I can t really survive without a PPI because it would be very uncomfortable I sometimes have these very weird burps that happen after I eat that sound very different like I m letting out a lot of air In addition to this I have some sort of IBS IBD Basically from my knowledge most people that have acid reflux it doesnt effect their ability to eat food But for me I get full really quickly now or definitely quicker than I used to So i get bloated and have early satiety Of course certain foods i suspect fried fatty foods breads etc cause it more than others but yeah I also have some sort of Anal Fissure or something that gives me sharp pain but only sometimes when I poop It hurts when im consipated or sometimes even when its these small thin poops it hurts the most which I don t get But I guess fiber is key This very well could be unrelated to the drinking but I felt I d list it because it might have to do with the gut problems I suspect my stomach lining got fcked from the alcohol and thats part of the reason for this But any input or advice would be cool I guess Might be the wrong subreddit for this but whatever ,Has anyone had the same health effects for drinking is knowledgable ,1
1502,Spent the weekend at a friend from out of towns house I got black out drunk amp I only know what my friends told me I got super sexual messed around with my friends got loud amp obnoxious etc They brushed it off said they were all ridiculous too but it doesn t matter They remember it I don t ,Wake up call,1

1545,At years old I admitted to myself that I was powerless over alcohol and my life had become unmanageable It was time to embark on my journey of sobriety if I wanted to live I did It lasted the better part of years Until it didn t My relapse began in my early s and lasted almost years I have now been gratefully sober for a little over years I m years old That ish year relapse almost killed me and definitely killed every important relationship I had This is what happens when an alcoholic is active in their addiction Nothing and no one is sacred or protected from the consequences of their choices I fight daily to have half of the strength my disease does Yes it s a disease The almost years of sobriety I had were no match for my alcoholic make up even with all of that time and knowledge of my issues under my belt I talked myself into the insanity and made the choice to drink My disease was far worse than it was in my s almost immediately I m STILL trying to rebuild all that I lost I share my struggles and victories publicly today because I fell flat on my face publicly I want the world to see that I m trying I m working I m doing everything I can to just do the next right thing and this shit is HARD Trying to repair broken trust and build new foundations in to old relationships that have been tarnished is fucking hard But I wake up each day determined to keep doing the next right thing and no matter what I don t take a drink When life gets too lifey I now have healthy tools and resources to utilize that get me through the moment I am Michelle I m a wife a daughter a sister and a mother and I m an alcoholic in recovery recovering publicly and loudly for all to hear and see in hopes of saving one person from having to go through some of this shit or of helping someone who s currently in it You can do this All of this is shared with love I always hope my words help someone but ultimately I am the one who benefits the most from sharing my experience strength and hope For that I am so very grateful ,Still an alcoholic ,1

1550,I have had a history of blowing up my career over my behavior and drinking at work events or work trips On the day to day I usually don t think much about alcohol because I am so busy taking care of my kid and I try to stay fairly healthy balanced yet work stuff always leads to trouble I m most likely an addict if I do get a drink it s never just one I have so many past experiences that I can t tell even my closest friends out of shame My co workers always end up kind of shocked because I am usually a shy conservative female until I get a few drinks in me I turn into a really loud belligerent idiot and I usually end up being overly sexual crude embarrassing etc Not sure if it s the anxiety about traveling mixed with the anxiety I already have about socializing in general but work trips always make me a train wreck of a human I just needed to reach out and see if others struggle like this because I m in a really dark place right now ,Work Travel Events and Drinking,1
1551, Since I was told that I had the disease of alcoholism in May of I have struggled to stop binge drinking and blacking out I knew early on that the key to understanding alcoholism was in Jim s story in the big book I suggest you read this story so you can relate to my post Jim had this foolish idea that he could drink whiskey if only he put it in milk Now the key word here is foolish as Jim is not a stupid or ignorant man This is called foolishness and how did he get to this point Deception self deception to be exact Now if you have read the story what comes next Destruction self destruction One more journey for Jim to the asylum the same one he just got out of and a good chance to loose his family Only to wake up remembering the insane idea won out asking ourselves how it could have happened again My take on this insanity extreme foolishness is the drink is always after the self deception It is a closed loop system that feeds back onto itself with self deception and self destruction asking myself how could this have happened to me again only to repeat that same process again in the not so far distant future It is a learnt process that for me was very hard to get out of In my opinion this parasitic processing of thinking is the addiction and the result is alcoholism From my experience once I stop drinking this mode of processing is self adaptive and I start to do other foolish behaviors only to say what am I doing full of anxiety and my foolish idea of having just one only to wake up and say to myself how did this happen to me again I wonder When will this end ,My story,1

1554,TV Isn t working tonight reminds me of a post here describing a terrible rock bottom with a TV not working during a hospital stay Got me thinking about what an alcoholics bottom experience can look like My counselor in rehab had spent a number of years in prison for murder A guy asked me to sponsor him so we went for a walk in a park where he soon told me he had murdered his children s mother Another guy cornered me after a meeting for some one on one he thought he was some kind of special case that couldn t use what had worked for me Saw in the news later that he had murdered his grandmother I don t think any of them got up in the morning got dresses and thought I think I ll kill somebody today Sure there are some Netflix documented whacko s who just aren t made like the rest of us but the incarceration industry relies mainly on people just like us drunk A thousand danger signs ignored a thousand false starts and broken promises When I admit my powerlessness over alcohol I admit that I am one drink away from those three guys I use AA to build as much distance away from their thinking as I can Guess I ll read a book instead of throwing a drunk at the TV tonight ,Terrible rock bottom,1

1559,M I ve been hanging in the background of this subreddit for the last few weeks For the last years my drinking has been getting completely out of control I always told myself it was just a phase it would sort it s self out Of course this didn t happen and was just classic excuses Two weeks ago i had a very bad night because as usual the party never stops for me I kept drinking and drinking Saying nasty and vicious stuff to my girlfriend close friends etc I swore off drinking still believing I wasn t an alcoholic After two weeks of no drinking this all took a turn for the worst last night I met up with an old friend to go jam at a studio I went to a pub for a few while i waited for her to arrive When she arrived i went into a local shop and bought cans to take with me The session went pretty well She dropped me off in town after and i went to another pub It was actually a good time met some awesome people When the pubs shut and it was time to go home my mood turned sour I knew i had to go home and face my girlfriend and my best friend who would know I d been drinking I got mad at myself anxious and eventually arrogant telling myself i was completely fine to drink like this When i got home i kicked off grabbed a bottle of something that had been in the cupboard and drank it in gulps My neighbour was in and she was trying to calm me and help me In my drink fuelled rage i wanted to go out and find a fight for some reason so i started grabbing weapons a long jacket boots etc It gets hazy after this but i didn t leave the house Next thing i remember was being alone in my living room paranoid my neighbours partner was wanting to hurt me This morning I ve woke up and as much as my GF and BF are upset and hurt they completely understand and have been really supportive My neighbour hasn t spoke to me but i have sent a message apologising I grabbed my phone came straight to this subreddit and i m finally able to admit that i am an alcoholic I m not in control and i need to overhaul my life the people in it the places i go and most importantly not to have that first drink again I m not sure exactly why I ve wrote this but it feels good to admit it Like a weight has been lifted but i know there is still a lot of work left to do I know the hardest part is in a while i can t let myself get too comfortable and convince myself that i can drink again and it ll be fine I know won t be Thank you if you ve read this far If anyone has any advice it would be much appreciated as i know advice is crucial with this kind of thing ,Finally admitting I m an alcoholic ,1
1560,Hello I ve just past months no alcohol and months no cocaine I joined a zoom meeting AA group in February and I have not participated but I have gotten so much from the speakers sharing their stories each session I ve probably been to meetings since then I haven t done the program properly in regards to doing the steps or getting a sponsor I have resistance to jump in fully as I feel like a fraud because I m not completely clean I have long term serious diagnosed depression and have been medicated for it I also take an weed edible a few times a month as it doesn t trigger self destructive behaviour for me I generally order some take out and watch a movie I guess what I m asking for is feedback on whether I can participate if I m committed to not drinking alcohol or using cocaine those substances were my downfall and I ve recognized that I keep coming back to the line the only requirement is the desire to stop drinking but I don t want to piss off a group if they become aware that I sometimes use cannabis Thanks for any feed back ,Afraid to participate without being completely clean,1

1562,There is a little niggle in my head that occasionally is like is this a cult but then I reason myself to say it can t be as it s suggested by governments recovery places etc I am struggling getting on my knees to pray to my higher power as it has past trauma linked with it toxic religious upbringing I am trying but how will I know when I can confidently say I have surrendered Will I always have tiny worries blips but as long as I shut it down with zoom meetings reasoning that it s the allergy etc then is it still right ,How do you know when you have fully surrendered to the higher power I m days sober been throwing myself in AA I am making it a part of my life as much as I can I do gratitude lists go on zooms daily Go to meetings and have just got a sponsor and about to start the steps ,1
1563,I usually drink with my best friend every time we hang we end the night getting drunk Ive been trying to stop drinking for the last couple of months and ive communicated that to her but she has a problem with drinking just as much as i do I really really want to stop drinking for my health and just to better myself overall i went to the mental hospital last November because of drinking but i only catch myself drinking when i hang out with her because i cant say no ,How do i say no to drinking ,1
1564,Today I m at one week AF I hit several rock bottoms during the past week Boyfriend almost left me last week after blowing my final chance ultimatum if you will but decided to give me ONE last chance We did separate for a few days so he could have space I stayed with my parents who were surprisingly supportive and hid all the alcohol from me When I told them my boyfriend and I might split they immediately asked Because of your drinking So it s been a well known problem everyone was aware of except ME I ve been in denial about the pain I ve been causing I also have a soon to be year old daughter to think about and set a good example for Then on Sunday I ended up in the hospital with a severely inflamed gallbladder and gallstones One stone was blocking the duct so I required emergency surgery I was hospitalized for almost days and due to the new covid surge I wasn t able to get a room nor have any visitors So I was stuck in the E R with no TV or company which was like an unofficial in patient rehab Me being alone with my thoughts really helped me self reflect Thankfully the surgery went well and I m currently recovering I was granted weeks off work The doctors gave me fluids to detox and I had a doctor sit and chat with me about my alcohol use and told me flat out if I keep going the way I am I will surely have liver failure and or liver cancer by age I m That was an eye opener for me I have a loving partner and amazing daughter that I want to live for be healthy for set a good example drinking is just not worth it I find myself not even craving it which is a good start I ve tried to quit before but was always on edge waiting for the next opportunity to drink My boyfriend has been supportive and keeps telling me he s proud of how strong I m being but I can see the doubt and fear in his eyes I know it ll take awhile to regain his trust and respect But it ll be all so worth it I feel this all happened for a reason Me deciding to quit and then being hospitalized immediately after just sealed the deal It s not just about our relationship anymore but my health is also on the line We only get one life and we all get the promise of death Whether I die tomorrow or in years I want it to be due to something that was OUT of my control In the meantime I want to enjoy the ride and not waste it Thanks for reading We ve got this ,One week AF my relationship AND health are on the line,1

1571,My partner is an alcoholic she admits this herself but can t seem to commit to recovery A week ago she promised to do days sober but lasted less than a week before asking to go to the pub as its Friday I stupidly relented for a couple now she s five pints deep had a gin and tonic and then ran off to take prescription medication Now she s passed on the bed I don t really know what to do I love her when she s sober but I can t take much more of this I ve had my own issues in the past but with this I m constantly tired and alway feels like I m the bad guy by stopping her having fun ,Don t know what to do,1
1572,I am days sober after detox rehab and submitting that I was not in control It worked very well and in some ways I have relearned and reloved rather than relived I know I m lucky I know I would have begged not to fear alcohol any longer The trees are greener food taste better but I am empty Can t focus at work Can t complete tasks well Being cross with my partner Assuming the worst Over reacting Not having emotional control I know what that sounds like Life before sobriety Even with the last days being tumultuous I don t want to drink I have cirrhosis and sobriety is my only path to life and I intend to honor that commitment but is this normal leading up to the work of step Is the cosmic ickiness pushing me back out of my comfort zones to do hard work I don t have a sponsor as I still cannot figure out how and I really really feel like they needed to discuss that more in treatment I am safe sober fed and loved today so this is not a crisis I ve been to a handful of meetings but I just feel like I m even bad at being an alcoholic Everyone seems to be coming in from something far less important than the meeting over drinker to over thinker,Im sober but what am I doing wrong ,1

1582,Alcoholism is hereditary I blame my father for passing the addiction gene to me My sister is lucky she intakes alcohol the same as my mother little doses amp then it makes them sick Although for my father amp I we can heavily drink without becoming sick and it barley looks as if we have been drinking This is a toxic trait and it gets you in a place you d rather not go I started drinking when I was it never truly became a deep seeded issue until I was almost I drank almost everyday by myself or with others I wasn t necessarily happy i was sad in ways going through life as we all do and alcohol intensified that sadness Many didn t see I was actually suffering because I was constantly intoxicated I brought alcohol to work I went to work drunk I brought alcohol to school I went to school drunk I had water bottles of alcohol in my car for when i was somewhere and needed a drink It took me a while to realize that I was addicted to alcohol I could honestly still can drink so much I couldn t feel it anymore I came to the realization I had an addiction when I practically let it control my life and who I was In ways I was partly still the same girl but I made bad decisions that affected others around me and myself I lacked attention from my ex boyfriend this type of attention I have always been greedy with because I was neglected by my father and alcohol made me turn to others for this attention I had so much anxiety when I felt neglected and I used that as an excuse to drink I used everything as an excuse to drink Hanging out with friends having a hard day being sad being bored celebrating an event Any excuse you can think of I had it and used it It s hard to explain how i became able to control my drinking I already naturally have so much energy and positivity I didn t need alcohol to give me a boost I still drink but I don t need it to get through anything or everything I have more self confidence I m not as needy or sad Drinking doesn t make you cool drinking is a depressant and if you have the shitty gene like I do it can destroy yourself and the ones you love I feel blessed that I have been able to overcome this and anyone with addiction has the strength to ,Being an alcoholic destroyed me,1
1583,TOWARD EMOTIONAL FREEDOM Since defective relations with other human beings have nearly always been the immediate cause of our woes including our alcoholism no field of investigation could yield more satisfying and valuable rewards than this one TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p Willingness is a peculiar thing for me in that over a period of time it seems to come first with awareness but then with a feeling of discomfort making me want to take some action As I reflected on taking the Eighth Step my willingness to make amends to others came as a desire for forgiveness of others and myself I felt forgiveness toward others after I became aware of my part in the difficulties of relationships I wanted to feel the peace and serenity described in the Promises From working the first seven Steps I became aware of whom I had harmed and that I had been my own worst enemy In order to restore my relationships with my fellow human beings I knew I would have to change I wanted to learn to live in harmony with myself and others so that I could also live in emotional freedom The beginning of the end to my isolation from my fellows and from God came when I wrote my Eighth Step list My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist My AA service Gdrive https tinyurl com AAGive Keep ,Daily Reflections Aug ,1

1585,Hi everyone My name is Steve and I m an alcoholic I will start this off by saying I am days alcohol free now I never thought I could not drink this long But in my hay day of drinking I would drive drunk frequently Ok frequently isn t correct I drive drunk damn near every night I would hit the bars closer them out then drive home My thought process every time was that I didn t want to leave my truck at the bar my parents who I lived with at the time would get pissed Anyway I did this well over times I don t have an exact number of course But I am lucky because I ended up getting a DUI without causing an accident It was a wake up call for me to stop drinking and driving About years after my DUI I began to drink and drive again I had fallen into a pretty deep depression still working on tbh I tried to kill myself times all while being completely hammered I spent days in an inpatient rehab mental health facility It was the best decision of my entire life I have spent the last two years working my butt off to get better And here is the thing it does get better I started off going to AA multiple times a week It was such a big help for me I feel more confident I have no hang overs I have better conversations and I just feel better It s not easy but you can do it I believe that everyone is a beautiful human being and is worth being around on this planet The journey is exciting It s the best part of life It s what life is all about The journey I have learned how to truly live life to the fullest Without alcohol in my life I have been able to change careers nice to a new city I got a dog and I bought my first home Those are things I don t think I would ve been able to accomplish while drinking I am grateful for getting to where I am today I am grateful to be alive and kicking so that I can share my experience with you today You can do it One day at a time You are worth it I promise ,I have an urge to share my story,1
1586,Day Lately my character flaws have been coming out I talked to my sponsor and he mentioned how that s the ism part of Alcoholism Thats how the alcoholic mind works that I m rationalizing with myself He also mentioned how rationalization is the first part in a relapse Which makes complete sense to me I m currently on my th step and I need to keep working it and hit more meetings no doubt I work rd shift and last night I went into work late due to oversleeping If I would have just went back home after seeing my oldest son I probably wouldn t have overslept and been late for work I ve been feeling discouraged because I m trying to work my attendance points off and I just got another half point I need some suggestions and encouragement ,Character Defects,1

1588,After all the turmoil with my nephew whom we currently care for it occurred to me that I never truly meditated on the fact that I could have become his guardian sooner if I had not been addicted to alcohol If I had not spend the better part of years dealing with my sobriety in selfish abandon Yesterday he asked me why I did not drink champagne at his first school day ceremony I told him in age appropriate words that I am not able to drink without becoming a horrible person And that I am gladly not drinking anymore I went to bed feeling like I never made amends to him I consulted my journal and asked my sponsor My sponsor is a wise person but not exactly an expert with children He advised I already make amends each day being the very best guardian I can be But he does not know if that is sufficient So he told me to ask for advise here How can making amends look like in this case Nephew is years old but as per his teacher quite mature for his age ,Step one important person still missing ,1
1589,A few months ago I found out my brother had problems with alcohol when my parents called me to let me know he d gone into rehab Rehab worked for a few months until it didn t work Another few weeks of not drinking passed until yesterday I saw him earlier today and had no idea he was drinking again I don t have the slightest clue about how to talk to him about this never mind support him I guess Alanon are the people to call How do they work How quickly do they respond My sister in law has asked me to look out for my nieces mid teens tomorrow night she expects my brother to be drinking again We ve never been great at talking about serious stuff how do I help ,Well I didn t expect I d be posting here ,1

1592,Hello Thank you for reading I am months sober and have been working with my sponsor for months I trust her but have a resentment that I m really trying to let go of towards her It began when she made a group text chat for her and her sponsees including myself One of the sponsees left the chat weeks later and my sponsor texted me individually saying how hurt she was by this and some other things It really took me aback and I felt uncomfortable At the time I was very insecure and didn t know how to respond with good boundaries I think now if that happened I may react differently Anyways the group chat continues and I really don t care for the random photos and statements They re not always connected to sobriety or recovery The group text was originally just to share a zoom ID and password I am trying to be willing to take direction and suggestion from her But I find myself becoming angry or resentful I feel a bit stuck and don t know how to be honest with her Thank you for your time and responses I appreciate it ,Group chat from my sponsor,1

1594,Hi everyone I d like your advice and suggestions about dealing with a group member who openly and regularly defies meeting rules and protocols This man has years of sobriety and hasn t had a sponsor since his last one passed away several years ago He shares every day and lectures all of us about what it was like for him years ago and what we should do to stay sober He is loud swears says the same things day after day and regularly tells us that he doesn t come to meetings to recover he comes to help others He comes late leaves shortly after sharing and ignores our meeting protocol of turning off his phone Invariably his phone rings or dings during every meeting He makes himself the center of attention and then once he has said his bit he doesn t extend respect to others by staying until the end Several long term members have found other meetings to attend so they can avoid him Everyone with a desire to stop drinking is welcome and I know I have the option of changing meetings if I don t like it This guys personality is having such a negative impact on the group that I am hopeful for advice on how to address this appropriately with the group How do I handle this in a group conscience discussion How have you all handled this in the past Do I just keep quiet pray for him and ride it out Thanks for your insight ,Need advice about a disruptive meeting member ,1
1595,I have had a past of drug use and alcohol use I came into AA a year ago and worked the steps with a therapist and have really made some great changes I am working with a company that is sealing my felonies so an employer can t see them After years of being free you can get most taken off in Illinois Because of Covid slowing the courts gods time etc that hasn t happened yet STILL I have decided to throw darts at the dart board of good jobs and I landed the first one I found I am six months minimum from getting this off my record says my lawyer But now I have a background check that just got sent to me I m going to have to explain myself one way or another I m thinking of sending this email out to them now before they screen me Just to warn them that I have a background BUT I am not sure I am also not sure of how much they will see since many services pop up different kinds of things on their backgrounds Now that I am writing this I can see I am trying to change and control this But it s truly because I found a great job using my real estate background to help homeless people get apartments And it s from home Just the best possible scenario Should I wait and see what they say or just tell them upfront before they see it the background check ,Not sure this belongs here but I m an alcoholic in need of some guidance ,1
1596,An interesting way to look at recovery is through the eyes of our finances When I came into the program I was not only broke but I was also seriously in debt with no hope of ever finding a way out of the deep hole I d dug I d become accustomed to spending every penny I earned or stole on drugs and alcohol then using whatever was left over for food and shelter I used whatever credit cards a bank was foolish enough to give me to further fund my dysfunctional lifestyle I begged borrowed or stole whatever was necessary to maintain enough of a buzz that I didn t have to feel the pain in my life My finances were but one of the heavy rocks holding me in slavery to my addictions when added to my selfishness shame guilt arrogance anger denial lying stealing hiding resentment and bitterness I was convinced I was doomed to die miserably and most of my days were spent simply waiting for that to happen There was no way I could ever get sober let alone dig my way out of the numerous deep holes I d dug But AA promised a solution and a way out of my hopelessness and despair One step at a time the weight of despair began to lift and darkness slowly turned to light one day at a time as I made small bits of progress hopelessness slowly turned into hopefulness I was learning how to move from emotional and spiritual bankruptcy to the first hints of recovery solvency And as I continued I began banking small amounts of recovery experience which grew over time into capital I could use to invest in others By making daily investments in my recovery my reserves grew and I had more freedom to move about my life without fear growing daily in confidence but without the arrogance I carried when I was using AA gave me for the first time in my life a sense of faith that all my messes could be cleaned up my ruined relationships could be restored my abysmal finances could be recovered and my bitterness and hatred could be healed Yes it took time and yes it was hard but the program worked and I got my life back Today my finances are healthy and expertly managed I m free from debt and have significant reserves from which to draw when I have an opportunity to serve I m not talking about money although that s also in excellent working order I m talking about my spiritual emotional relational and physical finances and despite having many days of sobriety it s this blessing of recovery that I cherish and into which I continue to make deposits Like my bank accounts when I stop making deposits the accounts stop growing and it doesn t take long for them to become overdrawn Every day is another opportunity to invest in my recovery and keep my accounts filled Without our Fellowship and program of recovery none of this would have been possible for me ,Banking on Recovery,1

1605,Is anyone else experiencing this I started drinking every night since like March I would get drunk all day during remote work and basically trained myself to become a functional alcohol About years prior I was addicted to cocaine for years I had a year sober period and then the alcohol came with the pandemic and uncertainty of where the world was going Even when I eventually returned to work I was a trained alcoholic Up until recently I had been getting smashed at least nights of the week Sometimes more Now I ve quit cold turkey Mostly because my organs have been hurting all the time Kidneys heart liver I don t even know how I m doing now The positive is that I have no interest in drinking or smoking weed Weed usually led to drinking But this anxiety is out of control All the paranoia I used to experience while binging cocaine is in full force while I m now sober I wake up not able to feel my chest and arms I cant sleep I can t eat I m constantly trying to catch my breath I think everyone is out to get me I truck rolls by and I m terrified My mind never stops My gf thinks I m back on drugs I just want to feel normal again Is anyone else experiencing something like this Or have any advice Thank you ,Alcohol withdrawal anxiety,1

1609,I m not really sure how to use reddit very well I ve never been huge with social media so I apologize if I m not up to date on everything this platform has to offer However I figured this would be the place to go for some insight I m days sober and struggling I m a year old male and I ve been a heavy daily drinker since I was years old This is the longest I ve remained absent from alcohol in the last years My daily intake ranged from drinks usually at night up until I turned I m in a particularly toxic amp codependent relationship which has caused me a great deal of stress injuries and run ins with the local police It s been going on for about a year and a half on and off We live together and don t have the financial means to separate About months ago I had discovered infidelities in my relationship Alongside coming to terms that my partner is a pathological liar who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder But if you asked me I d tell you she was misdiagnosed and is a clinical sociopath I tried to use alcohol to make my situation more tolerable perhaps to induce a mental blindness to the reality in which I was living It got out of control pretty quickly My mental health tanked in result I quit my job Anxiety was the main issue making work seem unbearable At my worst I was consuming about of a of abv liquor daily This continued for several months before withdrawal seemed to be constant no matter how much I drank My anxiety was also out of control I spent most of my time panicking and crying Getting to sleep was the worst part of everyday The anxiety was always worse at night We had gotten suddenly evicted from our apartment and were homeless for about a week before finding a new place We were living in an Airbnb The situation was a great deal of stress on top of having to manage my addiction I was confident we were screwed I suppose we got lucky Once we moved into the new place I made the decision to go through my withdrawal in hope to find clarity amp mental stability in sobriety I did taper and it did it very carefully I would consume exactly a shot of my liquor of choice every hours I did this for about days before going cold turkey The withdrawal wasn t too extreme Shakes stomach pains nausea mild visual impairment tracers and of course insomnia were the main symptoms This lasted about days After getting through the rough part the pink cloud phase began I felt great I was so proud of what I had accomplished I was finally living again functioning beyond what I had imagined It lasted roughly a week Then the hard part hit me Having to deal with all of the things I had been avoiding in my head mostly regarding my relationship and living situation I m finding it harder and harder to communicate and express love to my partner as I hold a lot of resentment against her Depression and a feeling of emptiness has consumed me Although I do have to state that my anxiety has significantly decreased post cessation I apologize for the lengthy post Hoping some of you out there can give me some pointers on what I can do moving forward , day sober amp struggling,1

1611,Alright I m at a crossroads I was making a fear inventory thinking of everything that I m afraid of It s a ton and understand I have some stuff to work on with myself Specifically letting go and letting god as I understand him One thing I came across was plastic hangers I as well as siblings were spanked up to or over swats each per session Varied based on moms anger that day Going up the lower back all the way to the ankles I involuntarily recoil when I see them Clearly I m holding onto resentment to work through But beyond physical abuse it turned mental emotional after running away to a friends house making a scene I realized today I don t love my mom I m remorseful to my ex wife my current gf my siblings their spouses my dad so I know I m future forecasting for step I don t know if it is wise to apologize to an abuser I called my mom to try to work through this All I wanted was for her to own up to abuse Not spanking as condoned by her Bible But the abuse and terror she put me through as an authority figure brings back bad memories My intent wasn t to force a confession but to just bring to light the fear and suppressed emotion It obviously didn t go as hoped though I m not surprised She has also compulsively lied and told my sibs that I told her to not contact my gf as to insinuate I am manipulative and isolating my gf I never said this and in fact was the one to give my gf a family members phone number so she could have support This isn t the first time she has pathologically been dishonest I ve been sober days Don t have plans to go back to my old ways Read the big book cover to cover Meetings everyday Sponsor But am looking for some advice from some other victims of abuse I will clean my side of the street not looking to change minds of someone who is beyond reason I WANT to let go I dont want to dwell but don t want to suppress either But as I see it letting go means keeping a family member at arms length Rationally I m fine with this Emotionally I m saddened by the loss of relationship but would rather surround myself with positive people who want to grow I ve received texts and letters from this person and interactions range from neutral to negative to downright enraging Let go or be dragged Where is the credit for all the things I did right I used a hanger because they broke before things got out of hand Your siblings had it worse Dad wouldn t let harm come to you You won t know until you have kids A million ways to say what happened was okay I get it She fed and clothed me I want to show gratitude where it s due But I recognize the Muenshester like relationship that wasn t healthy then or now for either of us She s bored without kids to control and has seemed to take pleasure in my and brothers heart health shit storm before I got on the right path with AA The fucked up part is I recognize the same irritability discontent and restlessness in both of us However I chose the bottle Not to hit kids and gaslight them then and now now adult I want to make it clear that I CHOSE to drink It helped me escape emotions work related stress and shortcomings defects of my character I recognize how selfish I was and am But I ve been lying and hiding for so long I just want to live honestly I feel set free by admitting to myself and others that I m an alcoholic Thanks for reading this if you did and am open willing to suggestion ,Letting go of abuse,1

1613,They send you to US for a reason This ridiculous tripe about don t make any major decisions for a year is bullshit Divorcing King Alcohol was a major decision EVERY Step is a major decision The Big Book makes clear that we need live life on God s terms How do I live life on God s terms if I m HIDING from His terms Getting married or divorced are major decisions Am I suppose to leave my bride at the altar because I decided to get sober today Or put off divorcing a cheating abusive spouse because I m not drunk enough to make the decision Getting a job is a major decision Am I supposed to leech off the family friends neighbors and communities I ve been abusing for decades JUST so i don t make a major decision for the next year Shit what if I m female and pregnant Having a baby is a major decision keeping it or giving it up for adoption is a major decision having an abortion is a major decision I d be FUCKED unless I commit suicide to avoid making the decision and THAT S a major decision DAMN The literature implores me to be fearless and thorough from the very start It tells me God can and will if he s sought It doesn t say don t get a God for a year because that s a major decision And then this shit about just don t drink and go to meetings cos meeting makers make it We are unable at certain times to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago We are without defense against the first drink BB Page If I could just not drink what the hell do I need A A for Go to meetings Where does the big book suggest running to meetings and regurgitating my feelings because we re all qualified to offer group therapy in here in are you FUCKING kidding me Unless you re making that in strictly speaker meetings what s the point You don t have anything to offer in terms of recovery and as pg states you can t transmit what you don t have therefore what good is it doing ANYBODY for a room full of non program working newcomers to sit around and share their misinformation and confusion with one another And no the Fellowship is NOT the program Here are the STEPS we took which are suggested as a program of recovery meeting makers make it make what gingerbread cookies I ve seen people go to a meeting go to the bar next door immediately after get in a car and die drunk the very same night WORK THE STEPS Rehab is KILLING us Statistically A A s were recovering successfully at a rate of almost prior to the advent of modern rehabs Since Less than of new members from onward have five years Stop listening to people who don t have a damn clue about alcoholism from experience and for the LOVE of God if YOU don t know what you re talking about DON T FUCKING TALK ABOUT IT ,Stop listening to rehabs ,1

1616,So for the last few years as my drinking has progressed I m getting to the point where I am being kicked out of bars and or being told that I m doing saying things that isn t me I don t know how to explain it The last issue was when I was at a bar that I frequented There was of us having a good time from what I remember The next day I went in after work for some drinks and I was barred They said I made some girl cry That s not me I fucking hate seeing women cry and I sure as hell would never do something that would make a woman cry Another time before that I apparently started a fight with someone I can throw down but I don t like to fight Not at all I never start fights EVER I don t remember any of these moments at all Is this common ,Asking about blackouts,1
1617,Last night as I was trying to fall asleep anxiety hit I kept thinking about how much of a loser I am the misdeeds I ve done and the general shit that makes you toss and turn all night Though instead of tossing and turning and hating myself during that anxiety ridden time I forced myself to analyze those feelings I made myself rethink those thoughts desect then to figure out why they were bothering me and by doing so I was able to identify some defects and remorse After finally figuring all that out I was able to pray and cast those defects to god So what started as an anxiety fueled tossing and turning night ended up being a break though in personal inventory and a great night sleep I guess what I m saying is I know a lot of you have these thoughts being affected by depression and anxiety through this already troublesome time but if you can control it you can also use these thoughts for good and will beable to advance in your spiritual journey , th Day,1

1641,Hi So background story I ve drifted away from aa for the last months Kinda went down a rabbit hole of wondering if I needed complete abstinence or not I figured alcohol wasn t that important anyways so there was no need to test it out I told myself im not out of aa I can go back whenever I want and that I really did want to someday mainly so I could sponsor other women since others tell me that s where the magic is Anyways I drank this beer with the guy I m dating at his apartment It was the last beer in his fridge so I couldn t have drank even if I wanted to continue Im not upset with myself for drinking I don t believe my life is in shams now because I had one beer I do know that the separation I ve had from alcohol has been very eye opening for me which is why I m turned off by the idea of drinking at all I m afraid it ll affect my relationship with god by me not continuing my spiritual practices It s hard to show up for yourself and others when alcohol is involved Anyways So I m not depressed I m actually feeling pretty great mentally and spiritually I have moments where I m not fond of aa like the last few months But ultimately I m grateful for the program So how would I get involved again I don t want others to look down on me cause I had one beer lol I just know that it doesn t align with what I want Idk Has anyone ever had one or a couple of drinks and then came back to aa even though nothing disastrous happened ,I had one beer after months sober ,1

1649,I turn soon and a lot has changed This may be a long post thank you for reading and helping Last Saturday was an all time low for me I was hospitalized for attempted suicide while visiting my girlfriend I started drink in th grade At the time it would be some Smirnoff ices every months While I began taking shot in Highschool the frequency of drinking never really increased I tried to limit my alcohol consumption because alcoholism runs in my family three family members currently fall victim to it I went to college and began drinking more often My freshman year wasn t bad although there would be spurts of blacking out and getting wasted After joining a fraternity my second semester I noticed I drank significantly more but so did everyone else hung out with My sophomore year I met my girlfriend She is above my league and I would be nervous around her this would result in me drinking before I hung out with her luckily we would go to parties together so it wouldn t be suspicious or weird As we started dating I became comfortable around her My junior year was pretty much my first incident It was HER st birthday and I blacked out at her pregame even though I couldn t go to the bars Normally blacking out wasn t that much of an issue but I was a mess there Her friends were no happy and she was concerned A few months later I turned and had a pregame I tried to not black out in fear of repairing the same events but my fraternity brother literally shoved alcohol down my mouth That night we had probably our first big fight I was saying nonsense called my ex to prove a point and puked all over her bathroom Senior year she moved back to DC she was a year older To not feel lonely I decided to live in the fraternity house Things then began to worsen again It was fun and games drinking but I had more incidents Shortly before my birthday I blacked out at th bars and cheated on my gf and got a lap dance from a Stripper I even got her snapchap to have sex with her that night luckily I fell asleep after ubering home More arguments with my gf ensued she even told me that she began having feeling for another guy I decided to go to grad school since COVID took away a lot of jobs That is when I really noticed that this relationship with alcohol began deteriorating I would be a dumbass and start fights when drinking with my friends I also would try to start fights at random people at the bars on the streets and even a nurse once who shared an Uber with me I even cheated on my gf again but getting another lap dance this time on my birthday but at the same strip club I noticed that I would become an aggressive drunk now This leads us to last week I went to dc to visit my gf for days I arrived Friday and we made plans to go out with her family friends to get bottomless mimosas At this time I haven t had alcohol in a while this is mostly because I started antidepressants and was scared to drink on it The days before going to DC I increased my prescription The day we drank was my second day on this increase xl bupropion I noticed that I got tipsy quickly but wanted to pace myself I began posting non pc content on social media while drinking I noticed I did this to spark arguments with people We went home and I was ready to stop I wanted to stop When I start drinking I find it very hard to stop I was also iced my my gf s brother different times one of them being a big bottle I was being a disrespectful dumbass infront if my gf her brother and young uncle I began telling her secrets and we had an argument I stormed off and began walking to her place I grabbed my suitcase told her parents that I think it is over between us and began walking to the airport hours away On the way to the airport I went to the liquor store and bought a fifth of whiskey I began crying and walking I called my gf that it is over I layed down on a patch of grass and told some more of my antidepressants She called again and I told her what I did I called my family and told them that I love them and said goodbye My girlfriend told my mom the situation my mom attempted suicide when I was young My girlfriend found me walking the streets with my suitcase in one hand and a bottle in the other She grabbed the bottle and threw it on the ground The cops arrived later and took me to the hospital for attempted suicide I went to the worst hospital in DC verified by the internet They took my belongings phone rosary and shoes They put me in a chair and locked me in a room with other mentally unstable people I was there for hours They ran out of water Took minutes to bring me ibuprofen after puking They wouldn t let me call my gf I had to tel them I was calling my sister Now I am home I don t feel good I wanted to have a good time drinking with my gf and her family I am still dating my gf but she isn t too hopeful about things right now and I don t blame her Even now I still crave a nice six pack of coors Even after all of this I would struggle

1667,So basically last year I was feeling a bit low I really didn t know how to become better since I had never faced this before I used to not get proper sleep and woke up after having dreams due to my anxiety So I just started noting what activities I did and whom I did it with in a google doc Slowly I also started rating how I felt about the interaction Soon I started to notice a pattern that I felt better when I hung out with some people and when I did certain activities This way I was able to feel much better than before and I gained confidence that I can control my own mental health I stopped dreaming as frequently since then I even built an app for this so that other people can do the same The app is called Happyer which was made based on the above experience and provides insights into impact of a given activity or friend The app also has a Find Therapist feature using which you can contact our therapists for help https play google com store apps details id com happyer life https play google com store apps details id com happyer life for android https apps apple com ca app happyer id https apps apple com ca app happyer id for iOS I have created a subreddit https www reddit com r Happyer https www reddit com r Happyer to help easily address issues bugs amp to allow users to share their happy experiences ,I developed a mental health related app that may help with addictions ,1

1670,I just came home from my first meeting and I can t help but feel this panic I completely understand that I need to stop drinking It s been the catalyst for some of the worst events in my life Yet I still find myself sitting here and thinking so I ll never go out for cocktails with my friends again I ll have to explain to a first date that I can t share a bottle of wine with them I feel so foolish and shallow for thinking these things I was feeling so positive and proud of myself when I came out of my meeting Why can t I stop these intrusive thoughts I know that I m doing the right thing but I watch tv and anytime I see a girl having a glass of wine cocktail I feel this disappointment in myself that I can never be casual about my drinking That I can t stop at just one or two I had the scary thought of backing out of this recovery since I m still in the early stage Like maybe I can just reduce my drinking rather than stop altogether or I ll just drink for my birthday weekend Is there any advice you could offer me I want to stay sober and in control of myself ,Just had my first meeting today and starting to get cold feet,1

1695,I have been sober for a few years because an alcoholic who had a relationship with God took me through the steps and got me to the point where I had a spiritual transformation I felt for a few months that I had finally been given a normal life that God had genuinely restored me to sanity The voices in my head were GONE and the fears endless worry etc were GONE I literally could not believe it I was living every single day in the fourth dimension Bill talks about and it was indescribable After moving a bunch of times and relocating ive found a lot of groups most groups it seems talking mostly about the fellowship using AA groups to rant about their personal problems endless slogans etc I worked with sponsors in these groups and I sponsored guys as best I could But slowly my life started changing not to blissful enjoyable sobriety walking in Union with my creator but to emotional turmoil still wanting to drink but shutting my mind to the possibility Feeling fearful of the time I eventually started veering away from the program because I felt I was getting nothing out of it And I thought if I only have an hour of self time I would rather just meditate or study the Big Book on my own It s been a few years of this and I am trying to find a guy to work with it s so frustrating knowing the solution and not having the means to implement that solution I have been meeting hopping for weeks waiting to hear just one person talk about the steps waiting to hear one person talk about What God has done in their lives And I have not heard anything I don t want to just coast through sobriety anymore I don t want to suffer through untreated alcoholism I guess I m partly ranting but also very much hoping someone can help me or point me in the right direction Thanks,Finding that fourth dimension experience,1

1698,DIDN T WE HURT ANYBODY Some of us though tripped over a very different snag We clung to the claim that when drinking we never hurt anybody but ourselves TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p This Step seemed so simple I identified several people whom I had harmed but they were no longer available Still I was uneasy about the Step and avoided conversations dealing with it In time I learned to investigate those Steps and areas of my life which made me uncomfortable My search revealed my parents who had been deeply hurt by my isolation from them my employer who worried about my absences my memory lapses my temper and the friends I had shunned without explanation As I faced the reality of the harm I had done Step Eight took on new meaning I am no longer uncomfortable and I feel clean and light Online Intergroup of Alcoholics Anonymous https aa intergroup org My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist My AA service Gdrive https tinyurl com AAGive Keep ,Daily Reflections Aug ,1

1706,I relapsed last night I m going to be attending AA meetings again I began to develop selective memory of my track record and flirt with the idea of using alcohol to further my ability to push social anxiety out of the way while socialising Such a huge delusion made so much sense in the moment to think anything good could have come out of depending on alcohol to create anything positive was insane One thing I ve found is that staying away from social activities consisting of being around drinking is a huge factor in maintaining my sobriety Which means staying out of certain circles for the meantime is the best idea Concentrating on myself and spending time with family and sober friends has been key so far in maintaining any sort of sobriety Guilt embarrassment and shame tend to be very prevalent when I relapse due to the explosive nature of them and although these emotions are yelling at me right now I m going to take this experience as a stepping stone and further incentive to attend AA and develop confidence in my sobriety one day at a time again ,Relapse,1
1707,Why would God tell me not to drink and not others We are all God s children I start viewing those outside even the most religious pious full of shit if they drink There are prayers in my religion over wine Religion is different than spirituality are the religion not spiritual Are they sick Just thoughts that come up in my head ,If this is a spiritual malady than how can those outside the rooms drink and still have a relationship with God ,1

1709,So essentially I ended things for the time being with my partner we both agreed that this isn t closing the door on us however I realized I had been codependent as fuck using her like a drug not really feeling the connection but I stayed in denial for awhile and convinced myself that I love her because I was so emotionally dependent and scared of being alone It wasn t fair for me to treat her like this anymore My partner was very supportive of my recovery and supportive of me taking care of myself for this season and I came to the conclusion that I have so much work to do on myself that I don t think I can be in a relationship right now without being codependent and fearful The fellowship has been great I have guys who are here for me and don t have to drink over it I m still in a lot of pain and grieving even though I ended the relationship feeling the post breakup regret like wait I loved her But knowing that I don t know myself well enough to love someone right now,Told my partner I need space,1

1742,Long story short I ve been struggling with alcohol addiction for as long as I can remember I have a soon to be year old toddler Her bio father ex husband isn t in the picture She has been raised by my current boyfriend of years since before she could walk or talk He really stepped in and I was blessed to meet him I ve tried to quit alcohol many times in the past year But I always relapse I ve tried going several weeks at a time without a drink then slowly reinforcing myself to limited drinks but once I start I can t stop I always want more I was already hospitalized in January with fatty liver but I can t stop Every time I drink now I get terrible pains I know I m hurting myself But I can t seem to quit it for good I am not a good partner or mother when I drink I ve passed out while watching my toddler once the lowest point of my life Thankfully my boyfriend was working from home and was able to get us both to bed but the incident scared my daughter she kept saying Mommy sick and my boyfriend has been scared to leave the house or have a social life with friends or coworkers because he s worried I ll do something like this again Every day is a struggle I m always hungover and have zero energy Sneaking alcohol behind his back has been a huge thing for us He gave me warning that he was tired of dealing with this and won t tolerate lying Well I screwed up and ordered some alcohol accidentally on his card He kept quiet about it for a week waiting for me to confess Finally today he tried to break up with me He said he loves us both but can t do this anymore That he feels like a single full time father and like he has to care for two children He has crazy hours pm to am and when he s not working he s depriving himself of sleep to take the baby off my hands I work from home am to pm weekdays I temporarily moved back in with my parents he was crying the entire time and insisting we stay through the end of the month since we paid August rent but later on after a long talk with family members I told him I was serious about quitting this time and I would check myself into a program if needed So we went from broken up to having a few days of space I truly believe this is contingent on whether I can prove I m actually going to change and step up when it comes to parenting and not deferring everything to him But I know it ll take a long time to earn his trust back I m so scared I ll mess up again It s not worth it to me to lose him I consider him my daughter s father and he s the one stable relationship I ve ever had in my life The one person I could turn to after a hard day The person I can lean on and trust I know it s in my best interest to quit this addiction not only for the sake of my relationship but for myself and daughter as well She deserves a sober happy Mommy Thanks for reading thus far any advice or encouragement is much appreciated ,In desperate need of help quitting for good,1
1743,A few years ago I was giving a friend a ride to a aa meeting and he asked if I could pick up his sisters friend and I did I m a guy and while I don t give newcomer girls a lift I made the exception So I end up driving her to meetings for a year and she is doing good but not taking it super seriously At the end of the year she says she s not an alcoholic and meets another guy in aa they both left aa And relapsed But my point is that I gave her rides was helpful to her but sometimes I wish I would of asked her out or hit on her It sucks doing the right thing sometimes was I wrong ,Did I do the right thing or was I overly cautious,1

1745,So lately I ve been feeling miserable feeling anxious panic attacks depressed feeling not present with my partner not feeling as connected or in love with my partner meetings feel routine Yesterday I prayed and I met up with a sponsee and got him started on his th step I felt peaceful for several hours after that then became consumed by anxiety I had all these mental health issues before recovery but they are so intertwined to my drinking that when I m overwhelmed by these feelings my body SCREAMS for a drink I hate it I hate feeling like this the liquor stopped working for me long ago but I will always have the mind of an alcoholic meaning my mind takes me back to a drink if I sit too long TLDR coming up on months feeling absolutely miserable can t drink but hitting a sober bottom if that makes sense,Almost months man do I need some help ,1
1746,One big part of the second step I like is how it says believing in a power greater than you can restore you to sanity Meaning you are not sane meaning your ideas and beliefs are fucked up and crazy meaning you need to change them and try something else I don t really agree with people who say try secular AA or other ways to beat around the bush The entire program is revolved around connecting you with a god of your understanding or higher power All of this bothered me when I first came into AA It bothered pretty much all of us the shit we did in our lives that leads us into the rooms is not behaviour of God fearing spiritually fit people But I can tell you that when I was actually ready to get sober and desperate for it I was not bothered by the prayers or the God talk I was beaten and broken and willing to give it a shot I would have done literally anything to get sober because I was a dead man if I didn t figure it out And they was crystal clear to me Suddenly closing my eyes and praying to something wasn t such a big deal Regardless of what I believed I was willing to try because I saw It worked for other people And I had accepted that what I was doing wasn t working that I knew jack shit about how to stay sober It was that moment when I started to recover ,Step ,1
1747, Good Evening I am not even sure where to begin with my tale I am a bastard that descends from a rd generation lineage of highly functional European alcoholics on both sides I have never found alcohol drinks to be a problem in my life as I can drink til the cows come home and I do not suffer from hangovers argue or cause fights I have a very intense job family and personal situation and I seem to be able to coast over the ebb and flows of life so far without any issues Knock on wood I am here today because I m about to hit and even though I don t have a solid reason to stop I need someone outside of my bubble to give me a slap upside the head I know that it will be all downhill at some point My blood numbers are all good I m fit and active It won t last forever I have recently lost young healthy friends that have been on the extreme end of healthy and it has me at that stage if you know what I mean Don t be too hard on me I really appreciate you taking the time to read this blubbery and provide any and all insight Have a great night , rd Generation Highly Functional Alcoholic,1
1748,I really don t know where to go from here I know I have a problem but it s not a dependency exactly just a coping mechanism and I don t know my limits I guess that could also be seen as denial Either way I hide how much I drink especially from my partner and sometimes use painkillers when I don t need them so I do know I have a problem I just don t really know where to go from here After admitting it to myself I m due to get married in a couple weeks and he has made it very clear in the past about not wanting to marry an alcoholic hence me hiding it he is a very supportive man when it comes to my mental illness but I guess he doesn t understand addiction luckily for him ,UK and don t know my options,1

1752,I recently attended a meeting and shared the following I love the simplicity of our program I work the same steps today that I worked when I first started in AA These are the same steps that we ask everyone to work no one graduates no one gets promoted and regardless of one s time in the program we re all equals when we take our seats and start the meeting We re all here to support our primary purpose which is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety Our program really is as simple as Dr Bob wrote on his prescription pad in February Trust God Clean House Help Others That said the devil s in the details and we all have to do the work and make our way through the steps in order to get better When I first came into AA all I wanted to do was stop drinking But as is commonly quipped take a drunken horse thief and sober them up and you have a horse thief I was a sober horse thief and it was devastating to discover I wasn t the upstanding outstanding moral man of honor I thought I was It took several years to clean up my messes and come to terms with who I really was dishonest step a coward ruled by fear step zero integrity keeping my word and having my insides match my outsides step prideful and ego driven step etc It took many more years of practicing the principles for them to start being reflected in my character A HUGE turning point for me was when I was about years sober and one of my best friends took me aside and lovingly but firmly said Steve I wouldn t give you a nickel for your sobriety That was devastating but a huge wake up call to stop being lazy stop pretending that I knew everything and come to terms with the fact I was a man of low moral character I was rescued by our program first as a way to get sober and break the brutal cycle of despair steps then a second time when I discovered the remainder of the steps were there to help rebuild my life and especially my character Today I see our program and the steps through a different lens that the principles are there to hone and refine us rebuilding our characters with the virtues necessary to be whole and complete to be people of honor and have our insides match our outsides to be responsible and disciplined and be aware of who and how we are as make our way through life I came to AA to stop drinking but I got WAY more than I expected it s not clich to say I really did get my WHOLE life back and the opportunity to live in a way that creates gratitude and respect ,Our Principles as Virtues,1

1758,I can t stop I know a lot of people probably have the same thing that s why we searched for this particular sub but shit I feel so trapped For context I am the bar supervisor for the biggest pub in my area UK and I fucking love my job not the booze but chatting and having a laugh on shift with my colleagues who I would say have become friends over the course of the past few months But I have had issues in the past and alcohol has destroyed basically every relationship I ve ever had and pushed me away from everyone I know and love it makes me feel like crap and drives my anxiety above and beyond what I thought possible I have probably needed help for a long time but I always thought I d conquer this on my own and well I sure showed me I just think I need to have a community I can talk to who want to embrace alcohol abstinence and even if it s terrible and hard don t want to just lose all sense and end up passing out on public transport or sleeping rough because you can t walk TL DR I just want to stop and don t know how please advise me,I think I just need some help,1
1759,After three years of this guy taking my frantic desperate needy calls and giving back nothing but support the day finally came yesterday where my sponsor called me because he had something weighing on his mind and just wanted to vent a little about it It was amazing to be on the receiving end of a call like that for a change and I m super grateful Feels like we ve turned a corner into a new phase of our sponsor sponsee dynamic and that s exciting More will be revealed they told me and I m starting to catch on to what that looks like Keep coming back ,My sponsor called me ,1
1760,Any one I went to one of their spiritual experiences almost ten years ago which a family member had been assisting For me was a really shocking experience and if I rethink what happened there it only makes me question their true intentions and means They burnt a big cross in the groupal climax catharsis and personally made me swear in front of a religious catholic idol Crucified Christ my father and some of his close friends that I will keep beating myself to death using drugs in a totally vulnerable open position because I couldn t enter into their sugested healing psychotic state or emotional catharsis Then in other retreat now sugested by another close family member who supposedly thinks it can help me with my issues I was harassed and consciously triggered to feel exposed and ashamed of my intimacy and this keeps ocurring constantly but that s another subject by an unknown individual At the ending prayer they made us swear again that we will not tell nothing of what we heard said made or saw in a kind of a biblical curse All while in a highly sugestionable state Don t get me wrong I m not a religious person but most mexicans are Even though I think it worsened my situation I have read the official books went to regular groups and I know that the practices in the unnoficial groups go against the steps traditions and concepts The nature of addiction makes people so isolated vulnerable and desperate that most can be manipulated abused or exploited by people with any kind of intentions Like cults And we know what can happen with those societies I wonder if I have been groomed to consciously develope an addiction to then be offered the solution by those selfrighteous gouvernamental mindcontroling obssesed sectarian freaks Just as The Hegelian Dialectic Problem Reaction Solution says ,Mexican amp step groups,1
1761,I relapsed after months and days sober I ve been trying this for years and that was the best I ve gotten previous times I got months once I need to go to a meeting but I m constantly avoiding it as I m either sick or don t want to come and show my ass after all the trust I built I got sober miles north and I m thinking I m gonna take a trip tomorrow morning there as I work from home and have drank tall boys today after days no drinking My sponsor is from there who I moved on from when I moved here six months ago but have rehired I need some wisdom here as I m not thinking straight You don t have to be nice just slap some sense into me This isn t going to get any better Mike,I m in a relapse and it s getting worse,1
1762,I hope it is okay to share and ask this here This is the first day of being sober I ve tried to get rid of my bad habits so often But unfortunately I m a person who gets addicted quickly I guess Everytime I tried to quit drinking or earlier on smoking I jump right into a new bad habit addiction So after a couple of rough years I ended up obese And now everytime I stop drinking for some days I start binge eating I m craving everything But mainly because I feel like I need something to fill this hole which is left without drinking I strongly feel like there is something missing Do you know what I mean I was wondering if some of you could share with me how you filled that hole Because I feel like nothing worked for me so far I ve tried meditation sports drinking tea instead and whatever But I still feel like there s this hole that needs to be filled And above that how long will this feeling last I deeply hope that I can find some answers and a supportive community here because I ve told nobody about my drinking problem yet I feel too guilty and ashamed Thank you ,Filling the hole,1
1763,Like the title states I have been sober now for over months I have been involved in the program for over three years but had a relapse in June of I have been struggling to get a sponsor and get back into the program My previous sponsor relapsed in February while I was working with him and he had been sober for nearly two years I want to get back to the program but I am struggling with willingness I guess I know that I am an alcoholic and that I need the program but I have been struggling to get to any meetings or find a new sponsor I haven t been to a meeting in about three months and I can feel the disease in my life I don t have a desire to drink right now but I feel restless and irritable and I am so quick to anger I recognize that my life is unmanageable in a lot of areas but am struggling to take action I feel so angry at myself at times for not being willing to do something as easy as going to a meeting for an hour when I was willing to do virtually anything while I was drinking I am worried about judgement from people in the rooms for not showing up for so long and for not having a sponsor I am also worried that people may think I am not a real alcoholic because I managed to stay sober for a while without a sponsor or regular meetings Just looking for any advice or encouragement from you guys Thank you , months sober but struggling to get back into the program,1

1765,I had my first AA experience yesterday and wanted to just document some of my thoughts and concerns I don t know if I m an alcoholic but I do know that I have a problem with alcohol There are days when I tell myself that I won t drink and it end up failing I also struggle to stop once I start I m not sure if I m an alcoholic but if I am I m probably a high functioning alcoholic as I have a good job and good relationships and it hasn t yet negatively impacted my life other than by making me spend excessive amounts of money When the person in AA asked if anyone was new it felt weird to say Hi I m name redacted and I m an alcoholic Honestly I didn t want to add the I m an alcoholic part but I did because I didn t want to offend anyone or make people think that I m judging them or that I think that I m better than them Can I still go to meetings if I don t want to give up alcohol I didn t mention this in the meeting yesterday I would like a community who knows what it s like to struggle with alcohol and I presently don t have that community But I don t want to give it up I just want to have more control over it and drink in moderation when I do drink I m not too enthused with how much religion is infused in the program I m an agnostic but like I said I would like a sense of community Maybe I am an alcoholic During the last half hour of the meeting I kept thinking about how I wanted to drink some wine so right after the meeting I went to the store and bought a bottle However I am pleased to say that I only had a glass I usually drink the entire bottle So yeah those are just some of my thoughts questions concerns ,Thoughts Concerns about AA,1

1777,My love we have had a great relationship together but now it needs to stop I remember our honeymoon one of the first times i tasted you you gave me confidence i could speak to whoever i wanted to and be the funniest guy in the room this was when our relationship was at it s best This was when i was at university i hadn t tasted you seriously before this and it was enlightening you gave me everything i ever wanted to have confidence long lasting sex the ability to say things i ve always wanted to say This was the honeymoon I think i ve been searching for this feeling since then but now you just make me sick Fast forward years you are still here still giving me strength and courage when i need it Now it s not just the beers one night every week to have fun now it has become beers everyday and some spirits if it s available The few hours in the day when you are not here i miss you and my body misses you more so much that i start shaking become dizzy i get nausea and headaches my anus is like a tap food is a nightmare drinking water is like drinking something strange considering you are my poison the late night texts to people i shouldn t be talking to You give me little white and black dots in my sight that float around when i need you because i need you more and more It s impossible for me now to spend a few hours without seeing you otherwise the anxiety and fear kicks in You control me Work is manageable but you are always in my mind The greatness you used to give me has turned into a disaster i don t feel anymore desire for you but i need you everyday just to not feel sick anymore You help me in my darkest moments you help me when i want to kill myself when i m feeling shit and need to escape you are the best excuse to everything the friend that wants to go hiking or for a bike ride no you give me the simplicity of just putting you down my throat and everything feels better After a while our relationship has become dysfunctional i don t want you anymore but i need you After searching that feeling that we had during our honeymoon i think now we have come to a point where i need to divorce you i don t want you in my life anymore Now i m in hospital trying to get away from you but i always think about you i probably always will but i don t want you to make decisions for me anymore or help me fuck up relationships friendships I wish you the best and please try to not fuck up other peoples lives Now after days of being sober i feel the biggest guilt and embarrassment and i want to make up for the past years of my life i lost because of you Yours sincerely Would love some help for the road ahead,Letter to alcohol,1
1778,I was always an absurd drinker but was able to maintain my life Homeowner in the Bay Area great job at amazing company had decent relationships and a lot of fun traveling to Tahoe and international trips Published in top journals That is until my mother got diagnosed with terminal cancer and I got a Costco card I would go to Costco every couple days to buy the Kirkland handle and cruise through it Add some nice addictions to adderall ambien and klonopin and I was constantly high I was able to maintain this for many years until a massive fuckup along with a secret DUI that was exposed and I was placed in Detox and then went to an IOP This is I stayed sober for about months until I landed at a Halloween party Drank a beer smoked a joint I was on cloud nine Then straight back to the vodka Since then I ve had relatively short periods of sobriety followed by increasingly fucked up benders These are not black out then go to work these are black out for a week and up in the hospital and a couple times jail These relapses have landed me in inpatient rehab times in years I quit my amazing job as they were closing in on me Got a new job and had a bender landed in the hospital They called it job abandonment Seems a little fucked being liberal SF but it s my fault take full responsibility I ve gotten a new job and am out on medical now likely to get laid off next week as this wasn t my first bender Additionally I ve been living in Sober Living Environments for the last years and have been booted from for my relapses Throw in another DUI for good measure There s a million other stories as you all know I guess the reason I am posting is that I was reviewing emails from the years even when I was fucked up I seemed like a reasonable happy well adjusted human My life has been nightmarily fucked out for the last years I have an empty beautiful house that I don t live in because of this disease I am essentially going to lose my rd job maybe Every time I relapse it s another major trauma and on some level one could call is PTSD I just can t believe how far I ve fallen As a functional alcoholic I was a fun loving charismatic dude that got his shit done Now I m some broken almost friendless non functioning human The alcoholism really accelerated during this time I have been trying to recover I have been to hundreds and hundreds of meetings I am on day Wish me luck ,I can not believe how far I have fallen,1

1785,I got down on my knees and begged and beseeched and petitioned my higher power to remove this insane reliance I had on alcohol He did What I ve learned over the past ten years is I really didn t have a drinking problem I have a living problem There s a blue book we study in the hallowed halls that tells us exactly that And it also tells us how to conquer it one day at a time And that is by dying Dying to self A little little bit every day Continue to watch for selfishness dishonesty resentment and fear Ask my HP to remove them at once I ve learned a lot about the state of my program and my spiritual growth during this pandemic It s been challenging and frustrating But I keep coming back to these words I keep coming back to this action And I keep climbing that ladder a little bit a time towards the sunlight I m finally headed in the right direction , Years ago today,1

1787,REMOVING THE GROUND GLASS The moral inventory is a cool examination of the damages that occurred to us during life and a sincere effort to look at them in a true perspective This has the effect of taking the ground glass out of us the emotional substance that still cuts and inhibits AS BILL SEES IT p My Eighth Step list used to drag me into a whirlpool of resentment After four years of sobriety I was blocked by denial connected with an ongoing abusive relationship The argument between fear and pride eased as the words of the Step moved from my head to my heart For the first time in years I opened my box of paints and poured out an honest rage an explosion of reds and blacks and yellows As I looked at the drawing tears of joy and relief flowed down my cheeks In my disease I had given up my art a self inflicted punishment far greater than any imposed from outside In my recovery I learned that the pain of my defects is the very substance God uses to cleanse my character and to set me free Online Intergroup of Alcoholics Anonymous https aa intergroup org My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist My AA service Gdrive https tinyurl com AAGive Keep ,Daily Reflections Aug ,1

1789,There were years between my first AA meeting and my last drink Before that last week long bender I d had almost full years of not drinking After that last week long bender my entire life and everything I cared about was lying at my feet broken The book talks about a jumping off place At this point it was a binary decision Live Die And I decided Die I spent a couple of days researching the best way to do it And on my way out to the garage to hang myself I found myself on the phone with my sponsor Ten minutes later he was at my house He dragged me to a meeting That was my higher power doing for me what I could not do for myself Grace In the meeting my sponsor dragged me to I heard a woman say Every morning I wake up and give my alcoholism to my higher power And she made a little gesture of pushing something across a table That gesture penetrated my brain I d never seen that woman in a meeting before or since I thought I can do that maybe The next day I went to the Men s Meeting Big Brian shared what was basically my story of multiple attempts over multiple years of trying half assed to get sober He was sober several years at this point and he said something that cut through my denial The only difference in this time and all them other times is I learned how to pray So I went home that night and knelt by the side of my bed and said Please help me It was the first sincere prayer that I d ever said I didn t know where the prayer was going or if anyone was listening but I prayed anyway because if it worked for Big Brain maybe it would work for me Please help me I have said that same prayer every day since I don t know why it works It wasn t until after doing an honest and complete th and th Step that the obsession was finally removed I learned that Steps and are the heart of Recovery I did and to the best of my ability I make prompt amends when I so something selfish or hurtful today I try to stay in today I try to not make everything about me I don t know why it works I tried for seven years to do it differently only using the parts of the AA program that I felt right for me I need every part of the AA program to remain sober one day at a time I need the book the meetings the fellowship the Steps the prayers all of it Self will didn t work for me Half measures didn t work for me I m grateful I learned that Even after I failed and failed and failed again AA allowed me to keep coming back until I heard a couple of things that cut through my bullshit And when I finally begged a higher power that I didn t really believe in for help things began to change for me Today I have a life filled with love and serenity and joy I don t know why AA works for me I only know that it does Keep coming back , years today,1

1794,I have been binge drinking for almost years now I never used to drink at all but then the death of someone close drove me to find some sort of mechanism and vodka is was now years later even after I ve moved on from that event Im not sure what quite to call it but it s like a urge I ll be fine for or days and then I ll get the urge to drink and it s so hard to tell my self I can t control it and always loose and end up drinking I want to stop drinking and have done for quite some time all the worst decisions I ve ever made in my life is down to me being drunk or drinking and I ve almost became known as the family drunk now and honestly I can control my urge for a couple of days but then the slightest thing can set me off if someone I m gaming with says their having a beer its then all I can think about or if it s Friday and I don t have work the next day my brains like but it s Friday and even though I m sitting here writing this saying to my self it s time to stop now seriously I know in or days I ll get that urge again and I ll end up drinking a bottle of vodka feeling like shit the next day asking my self why did I do it again and the problem is that when I do drink it s not a beer or two it will be a bottle of vodka or like a whole crate of beers or something like a shark with blood once I get the taste Question is does anyone have any good ways of dealing with that urge when it comes because I honestly feel if I can just get past the urge then I ll be okay I m not an every day drinker I m a times a week drinker maybe at a push but as I said when I drink its heavy heavy drinking sessions and I know after about years of it my liver is probably crying for help and after these drinking days I ve now started to not to be disgusting pass blood when I go to the toilet so it s a clear time to stop Thanks for the advice ,Advice,1

1797,Hey guys I m a year old man and I was having some mixed feelings about drinking alcohol after a life event and some behavior I ve noticed in myself I was hoping you guys could give me some perspective here and excuse me in advance for whining about my problems to you guys Essentially I have mixed feelings over whether I m overreacting to certain thoughts or if I m just now realizing the beginnings of an issue So essentially my uncle had problems with both alcohol and narcotics all of his life and passed of a drug overdose about a month and a half ago Aside from the pain of the loss itself this has really stirred up some worry about my drinking I was already noticing this was becoming a problem yet was possibly am sort of in denial about it when a couple people close to me commented that I was drinking a lot too much The rate at which I drink differs a lot but if I get on a roll ill wind up drinking every day Sometimes I tell myself I won t and then I allow myself to and honestly it feels like a loss I feel like the more I drink leads to wanting to drink more and also leads to drinking more in a given day if I do drink There s are times when I hardly drink at all less so recently save for taking off a couple days or a week here and there and I don t drink a crazy amount seeing as i m a small guy yet nonetheless it seems to me like I use life stress as a reason excuse to drink Anyways I don t think that s healthy This is a similar trap I ve seen most of my male family members fall into Particularly my dad who s just now admitting to the drinking problem he s had most of his adult life I think he d be considered a functioning alcoholic Duis in his s to his late s hes now and still drives under the influence Some other problems would be drinking heavily after work drinking at work getting too drunk in situations that don t call for it messy relationships anger immaturity etc Anyways I m noticing that I m now starting to fall into a similar trap That and I ve already noticed a tendency to get addicted to other things or substances to distract comfort myself from other life events Like for instance when I was I threw myself into video games for a regretful period and ended up playing for a ridiculous amount of hours and quitting my job I smoked cigarettes and vaped for years until just now quitting months ago I had an unhealthy relationship with porn for a while Anyways I decided to quit all of these at one time or another because I definitely used them as a crutch Side note i feel like a lot of these dependencies were related to each other in one way or another anyways now I m noticing that whatever insecurities weakeness and ego issues I have are allowing giving me an excuse to use alcohol as my newest potentially most dangerous crutch Yet it s almost like I m waiting for something bad to happen before I allow myself to admit it will be is a problem Like I needed to get a dui the few times I ve driven drunk or I needed to get into that bar fight the time or two I almost did when I didn t just let something go For me i think maybe ego and insecurity is the biggest issue of all and I m afraid I won t allow myself to grow as a person if I continue to find a crutch outside of the positive ones I have established Like for instance I work out and try to take pride in my job On the other hand I don t know if I m being overdrammtic because other people have it way worse in terms of life circumstance and addiction issues Part of me feels like kind of a dork for trying to make this into an issue maybe before it really is one And maybe part of my ego thinks hey I m not that guy or I m not going to be that guy I mean I really do like going out and drinking for the social aspect Am I going to miss out on experiences every year old is supposed to have if don t drink I mean I guess I will but at the end of the day that sacrifice may be worth it in the long run But meeting people s hard hitting on girls is hard dealing with stress is hard Maybe I need to take people s advice on building the actual confidence instead of finding a crutch Maybe revisit drinking later when I m in a better spot or maybe I should just learn from the mistakes of family and quit now instead of letting it seep back in ever Like maybe I wont be able to figure out the problems that make me want to drink if I continue to drink Or am I even the type of person who can drink casually without letting it become a problem I feel like maybe i m overthinking this though and maybe i m missing a beat here Okay thanks for reading if you did I feel like I m going around in circles a bit on this page and in my own head just flip flopping and being a bit chicken shit instead of making a clear distinction in my mind Sorry if everything s a little jumbled I m on my phone and I m not the best writer Have a good night ya ll , m Not sure if i m overreacting in wanting to stop drinking after recent experiences ,1
1798,My husband and I live in Florida His father is an alcoholic and has been drinking for over a decade He has highs and lows and tend to isolate himself I try reaching out and always try asking him to get out with us but he does not He is now taking anti anxiety medication that was helping him and first and even helped him stop drinking for three months Now he is drinking again and I think the meds and alcohol combo are making him worse A few days ago my husband told me his had a breakdown and started saying that if he was not such a coward he would shoot himself We are very worried and we don t know what to do He has expressed suicidal thoughts before over the years but it has been more intense more often lately He refuses to see a therapist Please any advice or recourses would help ,My alcoholic FIL having breakdowns and saying scary things advice needed,1
1799,Got back from my second meeting earlier today Lots of older folks and they welcomed me wholeheartedly and spoke to me about my doubts How should I go about asking someone to be my sponsor though I was given a list of names and numbers and I have a few people in mind but I don t quite know how to ask I suppose I just don t want to feel like I m bothering anybody even though I know I m absolutely not Also would it be weird to seek out a female sponsor I may or may not but it s complicated I m transgender born female but I currently live as male and everyone at these meetings assumes that I m just a regular guy but I did live a good chunk of my life as a woman and maybe a woman would understand me better I dunno though I get along better with men ,Sponsors,1

1806,This is a long one so my thanks for any that find their way reading to the end I am coming up on two years sober in just two weeks Nobody can say with certainty that they won t fall down that particular hole again but I feel very confident I will hit that anniversary Almost two years ago to the day was when I started tapering off of alcohol It s been a rough two years for sure Stopping drinking right before the start of a pandemic was not easy Staying sober was not easy Home schooling children was awful Discovering my daughter had pretty severe ADHD during the end of the last school year was not easy Having Type diabetes is not easy years now I am certainly not the only one who had a rough time of it I am sure I am not the only one to stay sober throughout either and to be counted as one of them is a moment of pride for me And I am certainly not casting any judgement on anyone who may have slipped That is certainly not my place And then there is my personal diagnosis with ADHD Specifically Hyperactivity and Inattentive During the process of learning about my daughter s condition I heard many assessment questions And almost all of them set off alarm bells Yes I do that Yes that happens to me Wait that is not normal So I found a licensed professional and got all the assessments myself And what I learned was that yes I have ADHD And due to my above average intelligence not tooting a horn here just stating part of the journey I was able to power through many difficulties growing up I taught myself how to learn I developed so many coping mechanisms And through sheer force of will I succeeded got my college degree and am reasonably successful in my field But nothing felt right Nothing felt done And everything was a herculean effort to get anything done I felt lost and unfulfilled I mean if I m a genius then why did I struggle so much It was depressing I was depressed all the time Rewind to my dalliances with alcohol starting after I graduated high school then into the binge drinking of colllege It always felt so right to drink I never wanted to just drink myself into oblivion I just wanted that feeling That feeling of bliss that came with the first drink And I wanted to maintain it Drinking to excess didn t start happening until later I got married I had kids Life happened and I had my drinking under complete control or so it seemed Then I sprained my MCL and my managable alcoholism became very much unmanaged as I used it to treat the pain At that same time I found out my wife had had an affair Alcohol was now acting as a crutch to function And I certainly had a drinking problem even if I didn t realize it at the time for those curious my wife and I sought counseling reconciled and are about to celebrate years of marriage But I got clean I didn t hit rock bottom in the classical sense but I certainly got scared that eventually something would happen I didn t want to end up in the hospital or worse So I tapered I quit I ended up exercising and weight lifting and getting fit I started drinking a lot of coffee too Turns out heavy caffeine consumption is also something untreated ADHD folks do And then came the ADHD diagnosis very recently I had made a pact with my daughter that if I did have it I would accept any medication the doctor thought appropriate and we would grow and go through this journey together Our relationship was not great beforehand And given both our diagnoses this makes sense in retrospect So I took the prescribed adderall And something startling happened I felt that rush like I had just had a drink Except I didn t want more I didn t need to maintain I felt focused Less fuzzy Present And most importantly I simply stopped having any urge to drink while the medication was working I even stopped craving coffee What I ve come to learn is that there is quite a link between alcoholism and ADHD My brain just doesn t make enough dopamine But drinking alcohol releases dopamine at first That s why I always felt more focused after a drink But we all know how that slippery slope goes So now with the adderall which is really just an amphetamine it activates my dopamine production and actually relaxes me unlike non ADHD people It was very liberating to learn that the start of my abuse of alcohol was a biological one I feel totally exonerated for starting to drink It is important to note that I continue to own who I became while drinking and take complete ownership for my actions while drinking But that urge to drink I may never have had to go through what I went through if diagnosis would have been better in the s or s How much further I could have gone But the past is the past and I am now content with my life Things are much better now My daughter and I are growing and getting closer I see happiness on the horizon It s nice being more relaxed less angry more present So thank you for reading about the first two years of my journey through sobriety I look forward to a sober tomorrow Every day is just one more day and that is good If any of my story strikes a chord in any reader I implore you to take an online assessment If that comes back leaning towards ADHD find a professional that focuses on adult diagnosis ADHD Get treatment if you want it and see if it helps It s never too late for self discovery It s never too late to feel better about your life Thank you for your time , years sober my journey with alcoholism and now ADHD long ,1

1815,REDOUBLING OUR EFFORTS To a degree he has already done this when taking moral inventory but now the time has come when he ought to redouble his efforts to see how many people he has hurt and in what ways TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS p As I continue to grow in sobriety I become more aware of myself as a person of worth In the process I am better able to see others as persons and with this comes the realization that these were people whom I had hurt in my drinking days I didn t just lie I lied about Tom I didn t just cheat I cheated Joe What were seemingly impersonal acts were really personal affronts because it was people people of worth whom I had harmed I need to do something about the people I have hurt so that I may enjoy a peaceful sobriety Online Intergroup of Alcoholics Anonymous https aa intergroup org My AA service YouTube https tinyurl com AAG KPlaylist My AA service Gdrive https tinyurl com AAGive Keep ,Daily Reflections Aug ,1
1816,Lol my alcoholic dad is complaining abt my drinking and saying I d be a better person sober How do I tell him he s one of the main reasons behind my addiction ,Lmao,1
1817,I m one month sober today I ve been to meetings though they are sparsely attended post pandemic I have yet to find a sponsor Meetings seem to be more like social clubs than a place for the newcomer to find a solution I suppose I ll add that to my fourth step I ve also been attending a weekly step meeting at my church with a friend of mine though for all the years he has been sober he has yet to work the steps The Big Book has been helpful And relying on a power greater than myself Corinthians ,One Month,1
1818,I m now I ve drank since I was Over the past year or two I have developed a very destructive relationship with alcohol Honestly not sure how it happened or why but I ve decided that it s best that I don t have any alcohol at all I know sobriety is a tough thing to pursue but it s a necessity at this point The money I ve lost on buying alcohol and minor accidents alone is ridiculous Among other embarrassing moments and just mindless decisions I m long overdue for change ,Starting my sobriety journey ,1
1819,Newly recovering alcoholic I guess I drank myself into pancreatitis and being sober was actually going ok Then I had one bad day and it turned into a sort of bender Now I m sitting back in the hospital with pancreatitis again and I feel so alone I let everyone down I ll be going into a rehab program soon but all I want to do right now is drink and cry , days sober thrown away,1
1820,I heard an aaa speaker that said that he was shy withdrawn anxious and he waited for a ufo to land down to him and say welcome home beu ass he was so apart from everyone And when he drank he wasn t shy apart from withdrawn ,Can anyone relate to what this speaker is saying ,1
1821,My first time posting I feel like my life is spiraling out of control Just a quick history I started drinking when I was partied throughout my teenage years and then I was mostly sober for a good year span My life has progressively gotten worse with literally every type of trauma that you can think of One thing after another a person can only take so much I ve turned to alcohol to numb my pain and I just have no limit I m an addict I don t know where to turn for help I don t know how to stop but I know I have to If I keep going down this road I will end up dead ,I Think I have a problem ,1
1822,After a couple years of daily drinking my wife had enough our th wedding anniversary I basically got the ultimatum detox or divorce I wasn t going to call her buff or even try to find out if it was only a buff but it worked I called and days later started the nightmare of withdrawal in a small detox center My mother drove me and promised to pick me up when I finished so I left my car at her place in the morning and she took me in My time came and I was discharged but I had decided since I happen to only live minutes from this center and it was beautiful sunny day that I would walk home I arrived home about minutes later came into see my with and daughter but my son was with my mother and had stayed with her the night before she just happened to text my wife and said he s ready to come home now to which my wife replied oh op just arrived home he ll come down and get him since he has to get the car anyways minute walk down the road and my mother is raving about how I scammed her and my wife scammed her into watching our son her grandson How why should he have to be in her care for hrs at a time when he comes to visit At this point I was only about minutes to hour out of detox but shes convinced I got out the day before and my wife set her up to keep our son over night I m baffled she said alot of things in front of my son who is old enough to understand what s being said and his whole demeanor changed it tore my heart out to watch a young boy go from bright and bubble to tears and sadness in minutes when he learned is grandmother doesn t want to have a sleepover or spend a day with him only a couple hours when she decides I fear whats going to come of this he adores his grandmother and constantly wants to spend anytime he can with her but now it seems she doesn t I m perplexed into a state of wanting to scream drink it all down to no emotion again or cut ties until a better time comes around I went to a meeting this evening and got my first chip but couldn t speak on it I d just cry in frustration and waste time My wife just wants to cut her out completely but I think she wants to do that to me to This has been my first hours out so far I haven t had a drop and I m looking forward to the first meeting I can get myself into tomorrow and probably as many as I can physically get my ass into a chair because my want is pushing had and the fight is getting harder Thank you for your patience with my terrible formatting grammar and probably spelling I just needed to share ,Detox was bad first night home turned out to be harder ,1
1823,I feel like I do I just came off a month sober try I drink every day with some days off here or there and then I ll have spurs of time where I m sober for a week or two Right now I m in the trenches home every day at drinking by or until I m buzzed usually beers OR shots I can stop when I feel I m where I want to be I start thinking of alcohol before I leave work and stand in front of the fridge waiting until an appropriate hour to begin I hide my drinking from my husband though he probably knows the extent I feel like I must have it Since I quit sober I ve wanted it non stop and I d rather do it than anything else It s a coping mechanism I guess I ve answered my own question somewhat I don t know how to replace substances in my life What can compare ,Have been wondering if I have a problem,1
1824,All four of my siblings know And I will be discussing what I feel with my sister in law whose dad was an alcoholic My parents are the only ones who don t have any idea as far as I know I want to tell them but I just don t know how ,How do I tell my parents I have a problem ,1
1825,I started taking them again before talking with my doctor because I was really struggling and didn t have health insurance but she agreed I can continue to take them I m on a low dose and taking them as prescribed Thoughts ,Can I still consider myself sober if I m still taking antidepressants,1
1826,I ve never been able to stay sober for more than days before AA It saved my life in the way that it made me realize that I have a thinking problem but there s a solution as long as I don t drink I m back on my day Before drinking I had called every person who s number I had gotten from AA and no one picked up or texted me back until the next day after my relapse I also went into my local meeting to get a sponsor and literally asked the first lady I saw and she asked me if I hit rock bottom yet as if me asking her to sponsor me was a no or waste of her time if I hadn t I know it s no ones responsibility but my own to stay sober but it really bothered me that she would respond like that We hadn t talked before but I knew from her shares she had years of sobriety Of course I know everyone has their own problems and can t babysit me and mine so I get where she s coming from also I don t know if she might be traumatized in the past by a sponsee calling at all hours ranting drunkenly etc and is just over it I know that the program works because I ve literally seen with my own eyes the peace people have found because of it and personally know people who got their life back from it but after my first sponsor relapsing when I was at days and triggering me to me spiraling into depression and no one answering my calls when I was at breaking point to me again reaching out for help again and feeling like she was doubting how serious I am about getting better I feel like I m supposed to just do it alone even though I feel like I can t and I don t know what to do ,Loosing faith in the program a bit ,1
1827,It s not the first time I ve tried but I ve normally relapsed by this point Due to my current situation I can t attend a meeting in person or online but someday I really want to ,I m just over a month sober and one day hope to go to some meetings,1
1828, She always was kind of a drinker but after she found out about her mothers cancer a year ago its a bottle of wine a day or so Now after her death its a bottle of wine and accusations that Im all bad and dont support her everyday But I knew that after death of her parent she ll be spiraling and asked her to go to therapy I found her a therapist wrote support letters attended the funerals arranged other help Tried to make her better with positive activities numerous times But nowadays she is either angry and picky or drunk She does not acknowledge the problem same as her alcoholic narcissist father btw whom we plan to send to a rehab and gets mad when I mention that she uses wine to evade the problems I really cant bear it anymore I dont have anything positive from this relationship for a long time all my proposals are being dismissed I forgot what is sex and what is a smile She accuses me of anything and denies my right to be sad or silent after her angry outbursts I really did everything I could to help her she just dont want to accept anything How should I behave I am really thinking about an ultimatum either its me and a therapy or its wine but without me I tried to make agreements to talk to her in an positive way but it became impossible I want to give her a chance I understand she is in grief but Im working from home Im near to support her I know what grief is I know other options to discharge the emotions but talking is futile Mb an ultimatum will wake her up ,After loosing a parent my wife drinks heavily What should I do ,1
1829,I used to turn to drinking spirits alone at home as a coping mechanisim for whenever I was feeling down sad or depressed The alcohol would either numb the pain loneliness or whatever I was feeling or it would be enough to act as a kind of mental block or limiter for my brain where it would just shut my mind down and stop it from being able to think about things for a while Eventually it would also help by sending me to sleep Just over a couple of months ago I had a mental breakdown drank heavily to try and cope with it and the short version is the state I was in ended up costing me the friendship of my closest friend the most important person in my life Since then I forced myself to quit partially because I of how drinking had ended up in me emotionally hurting someone I care deeply about and partially as a way for me to try and change hoping it might help toward redemption and a chance at earning back my friends forgiveness and friendship I successfully managed to cut off cold a horrid week of withdrawals and have managed to stay off ever since However it s all feeling in vain and I m losing hope it seems the change is too little too late and the thought and worry that I can t ever save or repair the friendship is adding more and more to my depression Each day I m struggling more and more to cope with my thoughts and pain without drinking I no longer have any block limiter to numb my pain or stop my thoughts The whole day my mind is full of thoughts over what happened regret pain of loss worry over what will happen and in the last few weeks suicidal thoughts not immeditate but a feeling that it s only a matter of time if I can t save the friendship It feels like my mind is under a constant migrane being crushed with all thoughts constantly swirling around in there at the same time Sometimes I can barely walk or stand as it just overwhelms my head and I can t function a few times I ve ended up dropping to my knees At work I ve had to go out back as I ve just mentally frozen or broken down and when getting back home I ve just collapsed on the bed not able to move as the thoughts get too much I ve barely been able to sleep the thoughts constantly keeping me awake or waking me up in the form of nightmares over what happened I m starting to think that if stopping drinking wasn t enough of a change and it s never going to help me earn back that friendship then what the hell is the point Why don t I just drown my sorrows away to at least stop the pain and depression I ve been suffering But then I remember I stopped it because it contriubted to the state I was in that night when I emotionally hurt my friend and that thought keeps me off of it I m doing it for her even if she never realises it or even cares about it I just don t know what else to use instead of alcohol I need something to stop my thoughts numb me and shut down my mind I m going insane and I don t think I can keeping going on for much longer I ve tried forcing myself with distractions TV games etc but I can t get into anything anymore a lot reminds me of my friend which is why I ve tried herbal teas legal botanical narcotics smoking blue lotus etc natural amp OTC aids Kalms etc anti depressants perscribed I m in therapy I ve tried crisis lines online support and none of it is helping I continue to get worse each day The only thing I ve found that s helpful have been some strong sleeping tablets however I can t use them everyday as I get resistant to them so I only end up able to use them for about nights per week I just have no idea what to do or how to cope there doesn t seem to be anything that works in the way alcohol did I m so tempted to turn back to it more so each day but I can t I feel I still owe it to my friend to stay off of it ,Been sober two months but I m losing my mind with no coping alternative ,1

1835,Hello everyone I am the partner of an alcoholic and I wanted you guys input I am a member of al Anon but there s only so much we understand about alcoholism from our side We ve F and M been together almost years Been through duis We had a huge breakup over drinking where I kicked him out of our apartment Now the apartment is just mines We took some time a part month Now He comes over often to meal prep cook because he now lives in a small room owned by an older lady who put out a Craigslist ad Recently his film he s a videographer career has been taking off This is his passion and it makes him really happy He s been working out and eating healthy He has been going to AA meetings and has a sponsor as well Things were going well However his video shoots went from baby showers and kids birthday parties to now music videos These have him out all night and of course around drugs Before this I was worried he was focusing more on his career than his sobriety This weekend he was flown out to New Orleans to shoot a video When he got back I noticed he looked tired but a different kind of tired My intuition told me something was off but I left it alone because I had no evidence Until I smelled his breath when he tried to give me a kiss I confronted him At first he was like The smell of the people around me got on me which was obviously a lie Then he asked if I wanted him to leave and I said yes I called him after he left because I was pissed and he finally admitted he did drink He said I went out of town and had a drink because I felt good very nonchalant Then he apologized for lying and said it was only a mistake and he was good the entire trip he just had a relapse and that recovery is not linear but overall he s doing good He said he s not going to beat himself up but move forward After crying about how tired he was of being an alcoholic and promising he is going to work to put his sobriety before his career We just fell asleep I woke up feeling blah Like maybe I m not hard enough on him Did I let him get away with it Is mistakes a part of the process I m going to therapy and working on myself as well and this whole alcohol situation is a rollercoaster I have no family support so I go to Al Anon and for the first time to this thread I already told him our contact is contingent upon his sobriety is this just a minor mistake and I m overreacting For any recovering alcoholics is this normal behavior Is investing this much time he works a corporate full time and do film into his career potentially dangerous while he s so fresh into his recovery He s pushing himself to get wealthy so fast which hustling to get financially ok is fine under normal conditions but we are not in a normal situation He claims he needs to just be strong around alcohol instead of trying to avoid it at functions I think he should try to avoid the presence of it all together while he s so new to recovery ,A question from the other side my partner just relapsed and I have no idea what to do ,1

1888,A realization I ve had is that quitting smoking is all about the mindset Let me clarify You can use Nic patches or any other type of Nic replacement You can switch to vaping you can use gum Etc The point is those are all substitutes Even if you re just chewing a mint gum that s a substitute one habit for another You re not kicking the habit you re just satisfying it in a different way To draw an analogy your kid really wants McDonalds He s throwing a tantrum wants a cheeseburger RIGHT NOW You can t get him McDonalds Instead you make him a cheeseburger at home In that sense you didn t kick his habit of wanting McDonalds He ll still want McDonalds You just patched it with something he doesn t want but will quiet him for a bit until the next day when he throws another tantrum for McDonalds And it will be an endless cycle Similarly you aren t kicking the habit when you substitute it for a piece of gum or seeds On a good day it will distract you On a bad day it will aggravate you more At the end of the day you re still living under the shadow of a cigarette You re under the mercy of a cigarette and how much you can control yourself for that single craving Multiple that by however many cigarettes you smoked in a day What I m getting at is then you start tallying up You start keeping count Okay today I fought off urges Tomorrow I will have fought off urges A week from now I m a week smoke free Your life revolves around the cigarette your cravings and your resistance You took a habit that was a big deal to you and made it into an even bigger deal after you tried to quit it Hence you re still a slave to it even after you stopped it On the other hand you hear about and see people who were a pack a day or more smokers for years And suddenly they dropped it No visible withdrawals no keeping tally You ask them when they stopped they couldn t tell you the exact date But They just know it was a while ago Hell some might even pick a cigarette once in a blue moon because they re out on a vacation at a bar or something But they re no more of a smoker than anyone else and they won t fall back into it Even smoker mothers who get pregnant They drop smoking in a heartbeat and don t think twice about it Again because of priorities This has nothing to do with addictive personality or any of that It comes down to one thing their mindset shifted They had other priorities come up Maybe they just didn t want to smoke anymore Maybe they suddenly had a baby Maybe they met someone Maybe they had a stroke And in that sense smoking was no longer a priority or even a thought Smoking because so minuscule that they didn t even think about it They didn t keep a tally they didn t fight off an urge They just moved on because they had more important things And in that sense quitting smoking is a mindset ,Quitting smoking has nothing to do with days and weeks and everything to do with mindset,0
1889,Monday th October I randomly picked up Allen Carrs Easyway To Stop Smoking and instantly knew I had to finish the book I longed it out for days as I had arrangements midweek I thought I had to smoke for but literally had to force myself to smoke as reading the book just changed my outlook on it on nd October was when I had my last cigarette It s been uncomfortable there s no denying that But I have actually enjoyed the feeling of withdrawal because I know no matter how hard it gets I will never have a cigarette again I started smoking when I was years old I am now years of nicotine addiction thinking I couldn t live without it that I actually ENJOYED it all done with It is such a beautiful journey , days strong ,0

1922,Im young and have been smoking for or years now I primarily vape these days but have alternated between that and cigarettes over the years In the summer of I smoked around packs a day and today on average I vape four juul pods per day I dont use juul but thats the best way to quantify vape use imo Bottom line is that with recent federal legislation even vaping is astronomically expensive now While I think its ridiculous we vilify vaping so much I m pretty much left with no choice but to quit Partly because I dont want to allocate more per month to nicotine than I already spend and partly because it pisses me off that congress can just control my life and what I consume My biggest hurdle is probably obvious to you by now but I genuinely dont care about the negatives of smoking I still love everything about it even if I know that objectively I will benefit from not using it Honestly what I d like to hear is the positives yall have felt from quitting Hopefully thatll re frame my mind because past attempts to quit have all failed in under hours for me I think I fail to remember what it was like to not be tethered Ive ordered nicotine patches that I will start using today depending on when they are delivered Appreciate yalls input ,I m not sure where to begin so any advice yall have is greatly appreciated,0
1923,I m now and a half days smoke free I told myself if I could make it through days I d be okay those first hours were pretty tough and I was hit hard by nicotine cravings but I like a challenge Plus once I d started the daily streak of no smoking I didn t want to break it The morning after my third day I had a dream just before waking side note I ve been sleeping so well even since the first day and feel really rested I dreamt I woke up on a beach took in a big breath of fresh air and looked out at the water which was shimmery pink and blue it was sunrise I got up and walked along the shoreline I walked along a pier and said how I really felt like going swimming I started back along to the beach and said how I love not smoking and how I love the mornings now I felt joyful saw a child playing thought how beautiful everything was Weirdly my ex was there the whole time and I was talking to them I ve only had bad dreams about them before but they didn t disrupt the peace of it at all they just followed me around felt calm for them to be there Then I woke up irl and immediately got out of bed and went for a jog without having to force myself at all I really wanted to and had a bunch of energy I did the same today It was a simple little dream but I guess having that sentiment come through in a dream is a nice feeling I ve quit quite a few times before but always ended up having just one Hopefully this will be the final time and the fact I ve quit drinking will likely help I d love to smoke forever but I feel better and enjoy no longer being a slave to any addictions ,Appreciation of being smoke free in a dream,0

1928,Hi folks You might remember me I posted back when I initially quit I quit in early August not a single cig in over two months I am currently battling cancer and after discovering I am peeing blood again when I shouldn t be I got weak and bought a pack I smoked about half the pack and I feel really ashamed of myself I am with bladder cancer After having my tumors removed my doctor scoped me again and noticed some pieces that he missed Now I am scheduled to have that same operation again First time I had complications and actually had to cath myself a few times The idea of doing that all again Anyway at work yesterday I noticed I was peeing blood again which should not be happening since I was healing so well according to the doc I went home early from work and started my leave early since my operation is in a few days I don t consider myself starting back Now that I have calmed down from my initial panic I am like damn what have I done Did I REALLY just start again after going through all that to quit I am not gonna let this beat me I am NOT letting cancer have me I will NOT let cigarettes get me either It is just hard and depressing Really don t have anyone to talk to about it either My co workers are friend like but mostly just acquaintances All of my blood relatives have already died my lifelong friends only really only had two are both dead My wife is a drunk and I think somewhere in there she cares too busy being self absorbed to worry about me But for her part I understand her Mom is suffering from dementia and she is her care giver She has toned down the drinking and is trying to take care of her so I don t give her any crap Can t really talk to her but not really upset wit her as she IS going through alot herself I plan on resuming my quest to beat cancer and stay off cigarettes I really don t know why I am posting this just bored and lonely I suppose Not really seeking pity or anything just felt like unloading a little I actually feel better writing this My cats like me though and they never judge They just stare and wait lol ,Backsliding a little after two months ,0

1957, It wasn t easy but I did it Quick background got addicted when I was in th grade and smoked a pack a day for years Anyhoo I ve decided that it was time to quit this year as I wanted to be able to see my future daughter grow and go to college and whatnot So I started with a Juul which went well and I was able to kick it off completely after days or so but after a while I ve realized that my nicotine addiction got more intense and I was consuming more nic than I was w normal cigs so I switched to freebase juice lower nic levels with a pod mod device After that point I ve decided to gradually decrease my nicotine intake until it s mg and I was able to decrease it to mg in weeks but then I realized the flavor had played a big role in why I vaped too much juice in a day so I ve ordered a special juice that had no flavor in it It was a bit weird but I got used to it and reduced my daily vaping amount by half After that I was convinced that I was pretty close to quitting completely very soon In the meanwhile my Doctor had put me on a new medication called Wellbutrin XL for my ADHD treatment I ve started taking it and after days or so it was a Thursday afternoon I just had my lunch and I ve noticed that it s been more than hours since the last time I took a hit from my vape and was pretty amazed by the fact that I didn t even think about it during that time So I quickly reached for my vape to take a hit and just thought to myself why don t you wait and see how much longer you can go vape less and I liked the idea so I put it back And BINGO that was the last time months had passed and I ve never touched it again Threw all my vape and smoking stuff away and never looked back All that process that I ve just told you about took me about a month and a half from starting to Juul until having my last vape drag But that doesn t mean that you can do it in months as well I was pretty aggressive and fast about it so it didn t take me long but it s different for everyone , Days SMOKE FREE Come check my story if you like,0

1960,I started vaping in Starting in I tried to stop several times most attempts lasted a few weeks before I would get triggered usually by drinking socially with friends who use nicotine This most recent time I decided to use nicotine pouches to help quit I think the hardest part for me was the hand to mouth habit so I figured I would try to break that without dealing with nicotine withdrawal on top of it I started at mg pouches using three per day and over a couple of weeks tapered down to one mg pouch daily until a month ago when I stopped completely It was pretty easy and after a couple of days I didn t really think of it or miss smoking or nicotine at all However the past two days it s been all I can think about and the urge to go buy a disposable vape is almost unbearable I m wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or has any advice to help get through this part without relapsing again I should also add that I just made a cross country move I stopped vaping just before leaving and used the pouches during the road trip and stopped using nicotine completely just before arriving in my new city I thought it would be easier since I don t have anything here that I associate with vaping unlike before when I was used to taking smoke breaks at work with my co workers and drove past my favorite vape shop frequently etc I guess I m just discouraged that it seemed to be going so well and now I m suddenly struggling so much ,Nicotine cravings flaring up one month after quitting,0

1964,And I have a message for everyone at the beginning of their new life The first week is horrible The addiction makes sure of that It tries to trick you into just one more smoke and everything is just aggravating and not fun BUT that one week at the beginning is worth everything else that follows By my second week I remember getting in my boyfriend s car after he picked me up and turning to him Wow you smell really nice today I said Are you wearing cologne And he replied I am I wear it every day I always wondered if you liked it This floored me Cigarettes stole my ability to smell how amazing my boy smelt And within the first two weeks I was able to get that back And that experience set the tone for the rest of my quitting experience A month in I started to cough less and noticed my post nasal drip wasn t acting up any more I even noticed it was easier to breathe when I laid down and I started to sleep a lot better months in I realized I was able to handle stress better I no longer felt like I needed to run away from everything I felt like I could concentrate better and I felt better all over Now I m here and I know everyone else in here can be too ,In two weeks it will be a year,0
1965,Hello Just found this subreddit I was addicted to cigarettes for a couple years I smoked a pack a day for maybe a year cut down a lot by rolling my own and vaping and eventually fully quit sometime last year I ve bought a couple packs since then usually smoked part of it remembered how shitty it feels and gave the rest away I work at a restaurant and many of my coworkers smoke or vape and would offer me some At first I didn t see an issue with it but now I m stuck with this problem habit where for many months I smoke almost like I m addicted to it Friday Sunday when I work I do doubles all weekend and then get days off lol where on a good day I ll only have one cigarette but sometimes up to like or especially if I drink which we can do for free there when we close And then go through withdrawals every Monday Tuesday and Wednesday but my bf smokes cigarettes and recently I ve been bumming some from him on those days and been close to being fully physically addicted again a couple times and made myself stop for a week or so before inevitably bumming more I have no mental issue with going days a week without nicotine if I m not around it I ve done it very often But I recognize the amount I m still smoking negatively affects me almost every day and I ve tried every strategy I know of to stop I set up reward systems for going without for a week weeks a month I journaled about how it makes me feel I got hemp cigarettes I told people not to offer to me And even then I can t stop myself from asking at least my bf we work together at least once a day when I work Any tips you can think of to give me Any media you think would be helpful for me to consume I wanna stop being a dick to my family every Monday ,Can t stop bumming smokes even without physical addiction,0

1970,Nearing the hour mark and this is the closest to quitting I have gotten in a while I keep trying and keep failing and every time I failed I said the same words just smoke There was never just one One quickly turns to two two to three and before I know it I m at a pack a day amp x B I still remember the first cigarette I smoked It was and I was my first week into med school We were celebrating with some drinks and my roommate pulled out a pack of cigarettes I had never smoked cigarettes in my life never wanted to do it neither Whenever someone offered I would say no thank you and usually leave because I couldn t stand the smell of cigarettes However while a tad bit too tipsy I took a cigarette and lit it up And oh man that rush that gets you the first time it was incredible Weeks went by and I smoked a cigarette here and there nothing too serious but then came the end of our first semester exams were nearing stress was high and I needed a damn smoke and then another one and then of course another one Quickly in a matter of weeks I started smoking a pack a day till the end of that semester Then came my first break had about a week off before next semester started and in that week I managed to quit Barely touched another cigarette for the next months even my smoker friends would say No even when I d repeatedly bother them for one Then came fourth semester The start of nd year with the largest hurdle over st year particularly rd semester I was at an all time high stress was at an all time low things were looking up And then I thought well damn a cigarette would be good right now And that s where the next years of my life went downhill with smokes Now I wasn t smoking because I was stressed I was smoking because I was happy In a fantastically idiotic fashion it meant I was smoking all the time for every possible reason Again within a few weeks I was at a pack a day At least this time I had thought of an alternative I was going to get a vape I got some Juul with pods and started tossing those back pods a day It was great because I didn t have to leave my room to hit a Juul like I had to with a cigarette so I could just do it every minute of every day Wake up in the morning and still in bed Juul Taking a shit Juul About to jump into the shower Juul Juul juul juul all the time And this kept up for the remainder of my nd year with really no attempts to quit At times I went back to cigarettes The feeling of lighting one up and taking the first puff The delicious taste of ash in my mouth I m honestly not quite sure what it is but there was just something about smokes that vapes just could not replicate My rd year though was where my eyes opened and I made several attempts and of course failed every time rd year is when the game changes a bit It s no longer locked in the library or in your room studying No now you re on the floor working interacting with patients and their families I ran into a few attending physicians that smoked you could smell them a mile away when they came back from their break I wanted a break I took my breaks Cigarette in the morning after waking up before I showered to be sure I didn t smell before I got to the hospital Cigarette after morning rounds didn t want my residents and attendings to get a whiff Cigarette after lunch Cigarette on my way home Cigarette here cigarette there cigarettes everywhere Saw my patient dying of COPD exacerbation Damn I could use a smoke after that Patient with COPD and COVID has their heart stop in the ICU and I had to do chest compressions Fuck I need a smoke How does that make sense I don t know you tell me It s like there are these little cigarette monkeys in my head that start running around whenever they get a chance I had always thought quitting was easy I just have to stop I would say I can start using smokeless tobacco like snuff pouches to wean myself down I even tried that went from using mg pouch every so often to popping x mg pouch every now and then somehow managed to up the dose see just wasn t cutting it And before I knew it I would be popping pouches while smoking cigarettes or hitting a vape But don t worry It s easy It s easy Is the worst thing I have ever told myself about anything Ever since rd year ended a few weeks ago I have had a lot of time to sit and think It seems almost universally true in my life that when I say it s easy I get lazy Losing and keeping weight off is easy Proceeds to put on lbs Putting on muscle is easy Proceeds to slack at the gym and atrophy like nobody s business Damn this class is really easy Proceeds to get lazy and by some heavenly blessing still manage to do well Easy is the worst word I had ever learned Nothing is easy This time I have convinced myself that this is one of the hardest things I will ever do I need to quit and to do that I need to stay vigilant No lapses no relapses If not for myself then for my patients I am at hours I no longer feel like murdering everyone around me I think this is going well but I don t think it s going easy This is unbelievably hard ,Quitting smoking From a student in the library to a student in the hospital,0

1973,Hey everyone I am currently in the process of quitting about a week in and I m mostly doing ok but the one thing that s absolutely killing me that I didn t expect is just how bad my throat is hurting How long does this last and does anyone have any advice for dealing with it until it s over Psychologically I think I have it on lock and everything else I can handle but the only thing that makes me want to smoke again is just to try and get rid of this goddamn sore throat cause it absolutely sucks Currently I am taking a frankly unhealthy amount of Excedrin trying to keep the pain from being too severe but it s not really cutting it What can I do to treat the pain It s been miserable for the last days now ,How to deal with sore throat ,0
1974,Out of all the times I have tried to stop this one has been the longest and the only advice I can give is to not count the days I dont even remeber a specific day I said I would start I Just did Counting days means that you will be continuously thinking of it and every time you go a little further from your goal you might think you gonna treat yourself just this one time and give it a little smoke I also suffer while watching a show and they smoke all the time like Mad Men or The sopranos but it is easier to ignore It has been around three months since I stoped I wish you strength on this journey ,Works for me ,0

1984,I understand why it s easy to believe the opposite You ve gone an hour or two without a cigarette you start to feel the nicotine pang so you smoke Suddenly you feel much better and more relaxed But the fact is nicotine was creating anxiety and tension and smoking another simply makes you feel the way non smokers feel all the time There is absolutely no credible scientific evidence that nicotine helps with tension or anxiety It is simply not true when someone explains that they continue to smoke because it helps them relax It absolutely does not Ask any smoker who has quit and started again With those first few cigarettes you feel absolutely nothing no relaxed feeling no sigh of relief It s because you aren t addicted yet and your body hasn t begun creating that anxiety and tension that cigarettes invariably create ,The idea that smoking helps anyone relax is an absolute myth ,0

2000,I have smoked since I was and I am I was a pack a day smoker for about or of those years The last year I am around a day Tried a few different strategies such as quitting at night Quitting in the morning Quitting during the day Quitting on the patch or lozenge Quitting while I am off work Quitting while I am working I am on champix now I tried it years ago and it felt like it worked Like I didnt feel like smoking but did anyways because I wasnt ready to quit Ive been on it for weeks today and it doesnt feel as helpful as before Like it kind of makes me forget about smoking but theres still mad cravings every so often I went hrs until this afternoon and cracked and bought a pack for no other reason because I am a little bitch and was being an idiot I originally felt like if I could just get day under my belt I would be able to beat this Now I just dont know what to do or feel Like youre supposed to pick a quit date within weeks of champix and im there now and am worried it will not work if I keep smoking Im a sober alcoholic years tomorow and when I realized that I got sobriety was when I stopped counting the days I was sober because the time in doesnt matter only the today does Im trying to have that make sense with smoking but it seems like its all about how many days it is equals your success I dont know if that makes any sense Alcohol for me was an acute disease Absolutely binge drinking wrecklessness that could of killed me or anyone else in my path at any time Smoking is this chronic addiction that takes a little bit at a time but isnt as near term devastating as alcohol is So it almost doesnt seem that bad or that I must quit sooner than later even though I want to Enough is enough Just want some feeddback from others or maybe this post is helpful to someone else I know its a tangent and not very organized post but its what came to me as I was writing Thanks for readin and look forward to any feedback ,Looking for advice and some help ,0

2083,TL DR I impulsively decided to quit all things nicotine related once again how do I commit to such an impossible task when I m at war with myself Today I had my last cigarette when my vape finally died and I couldn t find my bottle of juice I figured it was time I bought a vape to quit cigarettes and made a slow climb down from to but today it wasn t working so I smoked one last cigarette and I realized I hate these things Why do I do this to myself I get sick whenever I smoke any high levels of nicotine but I always crawl back like an abusive relationship A lot of negative thoughts swarm my mind when I think about how weak I am in the face of addiction Granted there have been a lot of unfortunate circumstances I find myself in but quitting these addictions would be a good step in the right direction right Then why is it so hard to do the one thing I know will be good for me Allen Carr s book arrives in two days I have been debating nicotine patches for a while but while growing up I ve watched my parents go down every route to try to quit and it never works I don t want to be like them in that aspect especially since it still hurts to watch them smoke cigarettes and that s something i would never want my child to experience it a helpless feeling and it never changed as I grew older I fact I think it s only become worse as I understand more and more I feel like this has become a rant I ll wrap it up this is definitely an impulsive choice to quit but I m worried that s all it ll ever be I don t know if I need advice or reassurance but what helped everyone else get through this obstacle ,Am I setting myself up for failure ,0

2087,I quit cold turkey about months ago and about weeks ago I had weeks when I pretty much made up my mind to take up smoking again I would think about it constantly I still don t know how I found the mental strength not to do this in the end This shows however how difficult this process has been for me I had really strong cravings for at least months whereas most online sources will tell you that you are completely free after weeks which constantly made me wonder what was wrong with me and if I can even succeed My friend who quit at the same time as me also pretty much forgot about the addiction after maybe months I haven t It is not too bad most of the time but I still feel like I m lacking something I just want this to be over I know that if I told myself from the past that I will have been nicotine free for months and considering smoking again I would probably get slapped in the face lol I know I have done well but I keep wondering when will I finally be free of this completely I only found forum online where people shared similar experiences explaining that it took them sometimes over months to really forget This really gave me another boost Have any of you felt this way past months How about Will it ever go away COMPLETELY ,When will this finally end ,0

2090,After smoking for more than years I had my last cigarette years ago tonight I took a pull off of what could easily have been my th cigarette of the day and somehow I saw how disgusting smoking really is The smell my fingers my breathing that cough that grimy feeling I threw my smoke to the ground where it belonged and said fuck this fuck this shit fuck off and turned my back on it I made that decision and I stuck to that decision Not a puff since The difference between this and every other time I tried to quit was a deep seeded feeling of determinatiin that I was going to be bigger than the addiction I was going to be in control of myself and my actions I didnt tell anyone either not even my wife She noticed at some point but I think I went months before telling anyone else No added pressure that way For any numbers oriented folks cigarettes a day over years is cigarettes not smoked Thats a fucking lot of cigarettes Maybe pulls on each that a million pulls I used to get up at night to pee and I would light a smoke so if I can do it and keep doing it it is in all of us you just have to really want it enough to put yourself in charge not the smoke Good luck to everyone struggling I know I tried to quit many times The best immediate advice I can give is DO NOT have that first cigarette of the day , Fucking Years ,0

2106,I ve only been a smoker for about a year Hell I still consider myself one Once an addict always an addict that s how I see it some things people don t forget I ve been mening to quit for a while and finally developed a tactic by which to succeed I originally wanted to reduce the smoking be it day by day or week by week and have loosely been doing that but it didn t work in the long term I have also been using a product known as snus a nicotine pouch placed between the gums and inner lip that wasn t to reduce my habit of smoking though I just wanted more of a kick out of nicotine as I didn t really catch a buzz off cigarettes alone anymore I now only use snus and don t smoke This is day for me I still get to feel some nicotine and perpetuate the ritualistic habit the drug entails for me This is my solution It does however keep me hooked on nicotine I don t crave snus as much as cigarettes though so it ll be an easier transition to stopping my use of nicotine altogether People used to tell me how tough it was to quit I believe them now It s tough but possible All you need is something to make the transition easier Be it the occasional smoke or a substitute It s not something that happens in one day It s a treacherous road to take ,I ve solved the riddle of my addiction,0
2107,I m tired of coughing tired of spending so much tired of stopping whathever I m doing and getting out to get my fix Most of all I m tired of smoking in front of my children and giving them a bad example First let s state the obstacles Nicotine is addictive My girlfriend smokes too and would like to stop too but she is not ready to stop Whenever I see her smoking I get a strong craving My life is very stressful with all the things I have to take care of my family my studies my mental health I have managed to reduce a lot in the last few weeks I don t buy packs anymore but cigarettes are always available if I ask my girlfriend She says she wants to be supportive and help me stop but I can t really count on her with this I have to do this mostly on my own If you have read this far I guess I would need advice about quitting when I live with someone who smokes Thank you have a good day ,I want to stop smoking but my girlfriend is not ready ,0
2108,I made it guys A complete year today Overall god damn do I feel better than I did when I was smoking I was not a heavy smoker I started with cigarettes maybe a pack a week and then I started vaping Oh lord did that got me addicted to nicotine I was smoking mg at the beginning which is enormous At the end I was at mg Then one day I told myself after this bottle i m over I did smoke cigarettes in the first week of trying to stop but after that it was OVER First month was very hard Me and my bf both stopped at the same time We were literally screaming at each other permanently for absolutely no reason lol But then I started to feel less tired and weird when I woke up in the morning I felt overall less stressed troughout the day I still do sometimes due to an anxiety disorder but it has been easier dealing with it Now I hardly even think of smoking anymore Sometimes i ll see coworkers or friends do it and for a split second I miss it but the thought of it passes as quick as it arrived I never get urges to smoke It s always just a brief thought of it and to be able to say no to it without feeling angry is so rewarding and feels so powerful What helped me get through it I would say is just the thought of having a better health more money in my pockets and tbh a big ego lol Also i m still super young f so stopping now was the best thing to do for my future self In retrospection this year has had its ups and downs but hey I havent smoked today i am also celebrating days without alcohol If you really want to stop I believe in you You are stronger than this nicotine bitch I hope you all a very good day sorry for my english , YEAR ,0
2109,I was able to stop smoking cigarettes for the most part by switching to vaping mainly juul pods which are way more addicting to me Salt nicotine coupled with the fact I can hit it just about anywhere left me with a strong and expensive habit I was planning on getting some snus pouches but they didn t have any so I grabbed these on Nicotine pouches which are filled with a soft white powder They ve helped me put sometime between vaping and not which will help me in a few weeks when I do a quick taper from these pouches Also saving me A LOT of money a day turned into a day and soon a day on something that I don t need or really even want The pouches are also small enough that when I put them in my upper lip it s not noticeable It s never to late no matter how many times you ve been unsuccessful Your future self will greatly appreciate it ,Can t go cold turkey but days smoke vape free thanks to these tobacco leaf free nicotine pouches ,0

2118,Once you went back to smoking did you suddenly go back to being your old self and forget about the painful months of withdrawal you went through when you first quit I m curious to know this because I quit a little over months ago cold turkey after smoking for years since it was my first quit ever but the difference between me and some of you is that I didn t want to quit I did it because of a health scare that turned out to be nothing and decided that I might as well just continue quit but i m months in and having a hard time still perhaps because I didn t have a goodbye or the urge to quit didn t come from me but external circumstances Anyway this is my question to all people who ve relapsed did you feel like yourself again after you relapsed Did it kill your depression anxiety I ve noticed that people who relapse often stop coming to this sub it must mean that they went on with their livrs as smokers forgettinf about the mental state of withdrawal misery After months I still think I m forcing myself to stay quit and I m still unhappy because I don t get to smoke like I used to I m still suffering from some withdrawal anxiety but nothing crippling anxiety that was non existant back when I used to smoke ,Question for people who relapsed,0

2127,So I smoke a whole lot on weekends possibly two packs or more when I m over at my boyfriend s and virtually nothing during the week because I live with my mom and she would freak out if she were to find out I smoke occasionally I rarely crave cigarettes during the week anyway but ever since I established this pattern I feel extremely anxious all week when previously I was calm and even during difficult times could keep my anxiety more or less under control Now this is irrational anxiety in that I m scared of my perfectly lovely boyfriend leaving me for no reason at all I was ok with this last year and we barely saw each other due to covid why is this happening now of all times Am I ok on the weekends because I m by his side or because I get to smoke a ton ,Is my anxiety due to withdrawal ,0
2128,I also stopped the NRT days ago since it s not recommended by the Easyway program Alan Carr I am however staying on Wellbutrin for the time being Not smoking has been going great and I m not tempted at all to light up a cigarette BUT I was definitely battling some nicotine cravings yesterday evening Today is good so far Maybe because it s been hours since ditching the nicotine gum lozenges and so it s mostly out of my system I definitely need to pick up some regular gum mints though The only gum in the house is my kids stash and it s all things like Bubbalicious Gross So that s my mission for today Going to see a movie later first time in a movie theatre in almost years and costume shopping after so that s a nice distraction Hope everyone is having an awesome day , week done,0

2131,So I m not sure how long it s been since I quit I found that for myself keeping track of the days only kept my kind on cigarettes so I m treating it like it was mever a part of my life It s been less than a couple weeks probably I d quit for months at a time or more then pick it up again and I ve repeated this probably times over the last years My parent s families are both huge and they had me late and dad s genes aren t the best so everytime I d quit someone died Been to about funerals in that time span and not to mention both my parents smoke like chimneys but I don t like making excuses and I felt shitty every time I picked it back up So here s to hoping I don t have to forget how long it s been since my last cigarette again I ve never reached out to a forum or platform of any kind so I m hoping airing it out a little bit will give me a greater sense of responsibility to stay off it Full disclosure I smoke the equivalent of about half a joint of weed a day or less and that significantly helps with withdrawals and insomnia cessation and non cessation related I stick to my hobbies heavier now as well Fishing gaming and music and feel much better as a whole I m just rambling at this point My bad Best of luck to all of you who want to quit ,I really want this to be the last time I quit ,0

2138,Hello there i quitted smocking almoust a year ago i never had any heavy symtoms but recently i started to become nightmares about smoking again To be fair the dreams i have are nothing scary but rather realisticly so i may started smoking again The way i approached my exit strategy was simple i switched to vaping and tried to figure out why i would smoke in the first place Since i read that this is how you would approach any other addiction When i figured out why i smoked i could easilly quit but now even though i sucsessfully quitted for a year now without any feel of quit im right in this weird situtation and i wonder if people did experience the same To be fair i changed alot along quitting like doing more sports and only for that i would never go back to smoking But it is weird that my brain seems to still be busy with that ,Nightmares about smoking after a year of quitting anyone else ,0
2139,I m still a tad bit in the surreal zone and needed somewhere to air my thoughts I m on day tomorrow is one week and I m proud of myself probs the most ever I ve been mostly caffeine free for the years sweet tea only I am off and on with weed I drink a maximum of one soda a day and now no cigarettes Super surreal that this day has come Here s the story I started in middle school off and on and that continued increasing until hs Senior year I quit Come time to go to bars and clubs I was back to socially smoking That eventually spilled over into every day life Over the years I d set dates to quit Like the back of the shampoo bottle rinse and repeat Tons of failures over the years light failures because was my mind really there ready to quit Then I set a hard date where I had to quit that passed by which was last year Then September hit and my brain realized I had just swept it under the rug like nothing and so at that point I made a promise to myself to quit by October st but this time had to be different because I was just not going to buy another pack Pack after pack the cravings pushed me to give in but my rule was when you finish a pack you have to wait as long as you can before giving in The longest I made it was hrs without buying a pack Last Friday hit my last cig in the pack was around mid day and I started getting that feeling so I pushed it to the end of the day cig before bed The biggest part of it in my opinion is being ready Nobody else can do that for you For me I asked myself if I want to smoke a year from now and it d always be an answer of no but I never pushed myself to do something about it The second biggest thing is to talk to someone in my case it is a friend who has quit so there s the relatable portion of knowing what its like As of right now I still take my smoke breaks just to get away and let it all go I still have cravings I still love cigs but they re not for me I put them into the same place as some of the harder things I used to do they re not for me Day Thank you for giving me a place to let this out ,Day ,0

2175,I ve only been a nicotine addict for less than a year since I turned and I ve been successfully been able to avoid it for over two weeks now but the daily cravings and need to convince myself not to give in almost every day is getting frustrating I m a student and I managed to stay away from nicotine for about months over the summer but started the habit again when the semester started until I stopped it recently The cravings have been relatively easy to disregard since a little before the st of the month but today for whatever reason I ve been debating with myself whether I should allow myself just one smoke all day And at the gas station this evening while getting snacks I was SO close to giving in and asking the cashier for a Black amp Mild The only thing that stopped me was convincing myself to be content with the alcohol I was already buying and admitting to the cashier that I was conflicted over whether I should buy a black n mild which made me feel pathetic I know this is kind of incoherent and ramble y but I feel so much like a failure and like such a piece of shit and would like some advice encouragement If it s relevant I also have ADHD and have been sober from weed for roughly the same amount of time from nicotine which I ve been craving much more than weed ,When do the cravings stop ,0
2176,I quit smoking months ago From the get go I struggled with psychological cravings and used food to comfort me replace ciggie cravings I ate a bit more than usual due to cravings and getting my sense of taste back but it was always under control and never worried me too much For the last week I ve stopped my nicotine replacement therapy I was down to around mg a day so very low Since then my physical hunger has gone through the roof I m quite slim and never had a huge appetite but for the past few days I feel like I m constantly starving I m getting very hungry one or two hours after eating and nothing seems to properly satisfy my hunger I m not eating for comfort but because I feel so physically hungry As someone that never really got hungry it feels like I ve lost control over my body Is this normal How long is this going to last And any tips for dealing with what feels like extreme hunger ,Help with hunger months smoke free week without NRT,0
2177,I stopped smoking days ago cold turkey I hadn t planned it I woke up at in the morning not unusual for a smoker breathing was terrible and just thought I had to do this sometime maybe I could do it today Went back to sleep but remembered when I woke up and gave it a go I often had those thoughts at in the morning I usually ignored them by the time I got up I honestly can t tell you why it was different this time sometimes you just build up the will power I m I ve smoked for years mostly a day but probably the past couple of years It hasn t done me any favours with my skin hair breathing fitness savings This is probably my th serious quit I ve managed and months before I hope this is the one Im waffling on the reason I m posting is to give some reassurance to those a few weeks behind my journey I found it really difficult for most of the first and a half weeks some good days to keep me sane but otherwise it just felt relentless Never ending Week was particularly hard until I realized it was week and just needed to get through it Week was a nightmare because I thought week was supposed to be the worst But now all of a sudden it s so so much easier I can focus on the positives of not smoking rather than constantly mourn the loss Theres still a couple of times a day when I d love a smoke and I think about them often that probably sounds scary but it s not that bad at all it s not in that all consuming way of the first weeks It s such a relief It does get better It does get easier I m so pleased with myself when I remember that I forgot to think about smoking My husband is a very dedicated smoker so there s always tobacco in the house but that s ok The trick is to remember that in x amount of months when I think I can just have one I can t I hope this time sticks In short it got so much easier for me after or so weeks hang in there ,Getting there,0
2178,I quit smoking years ago but was majorly hooked on nicotine lozenges and gum for far too long I posted here two months ago about my plan to wean off and quit Took a bit longer than I expected but dropped from about mg a day down to mg a day I did not plan for today to be the day but I just felt like I was done with those delicious lozenges and time to move on Feeling a bit depressed and frustrated but no desire to have nicotine because I do not want to have to relive this day again For those considering NRT or currently on NRT it s really not as bad as quitting smoking I would do it all again as I was a heavy smoker of about a pack and a half a day and NRT got me off that ,First day off NRT,0

2186,I m currently on day after quitting my year habit of smoking about sticks a day I quit cold turkey after reading Carr s book This is my first quit I ve had almost none physical withdrawal symptoms and a few stronger than average cravings that I ofc acknowledged but didn t have to really struggle or anything All the nicotine should ve left my body by now so it seems the physical addiction should be easing up My question I guess is this can it really be this easy Or is the worst part still somehow coming How to prepare myself for the future I would ve expected the st week to be the worst both mentally and physically and then gradually easing up My quit has been so easy from the start that it feels surreal to be going back to smoking And yet the majority of posts that I m reading here or on FB groups are by people who have quit numerous times This is also backed up by the statistics In these posts people have stayed quit for months a year or years before picking up smoking again And then quitting again I d love to know if there are any active first time quitters here who similar thoughts experiences How about the people with more than one quits are these your thoughts as well before Life happening Any words of wisdom , st Quit Last Quit ,0

2192,Used Carr s book and whyquit com but didn t finish them although they did help in the initial weeks No longer panic if I ve run out of cigs nor stress if I m running low cos I don t smoke That really is incredible freedom and eventually becomes a norm without considering the previous burden I no longer need to leave situations to get a fix and so I don t interrupt our family activities which feels wonderful I still catch myself thinking I would have left and missed this or that I don t stink of smoke With kids and a partner who doesn t smoke this is a huge deal for us Don t really have any strong cravings or maybe even cravings just perhaps fond memories at times which are followed by it s never gonna happen and remember the shit that comes with that money saved but money spent It wasn t easy but after the initial weeks it settles down and becomes normalised so I hope this gives people hope who are nearer this stage than years although the year people give me hope One last thing I stopped cold turkey having previously tried various cutting down or NRT methods I m convinced this was the reason for getting this far although the Carr book app whyquit com have their place as useful additions to the toolkit , months in story so far,0

2209,Hi everyone I was recently talking to someone about quitting smoking and decided to pop back on here to check my number to see how long it has actually been since I quit It s been over years To anyone quitting now I am proof that it is possible for anyone I quit at age after trying to quit unsuccessfully for about a decade Remember that every time you try to quit whether you succeed or not that attempt you are closer to quitting I do believe that I first quit at age by reading Allen Carr s book Easy Way to Quit Smoking I had heard that if you read this book you would quit immediately and not suffer through withdrawal It sounded like utter bullshit to me But you were allowed smoke while reading it so I figured I d try it to prove what bullshit it was I read the book It wasn t magic or anything It just goes bit by bit and convinces you that you don t need to smoke and that you are just a drug addict stuck in the nicotine trap I smoked the whole time I read it I finished it and went to bed I woke up the next day and didn t want to smoke I quit for about months Then I went to a party where everyone was smoking It had been so long and smoking looked so fun I figured one cigarette wouldn t kill me Well down the slippery slope I went Next time with friends I bummed more cigarettes Soon I was buying packs just for when I was going to be drinking Pretty soon after that I was smoking again Carr s book said that once you quit all it will take is cigarette to get you going again and he was absolutely right I smoked for another year or so absolutely furious with myself Finally I decided that enough was enough and I was going to try to quit again I remembered everything I had read in the book and was able to quit cold turkey and never smoke again I haven t had a cigarette in over years and I haven t missed it at all I am so thankful and happy that I do not have to smoke anymore I will be at parties and events now and try to mindfully think about how much I would have missed before because I was constantly running outside to smoke I take deep breaths and enjoy my clear lungs I look at the price of cigarettes at convenience stores and smile that I m not shelling out thousands of dollars on it anymore Not sure if this wall of text will be helpful to anyone but I hope so If anyone is thinking of quitting I d recommend the book If anyone has already started keep it up You really can do it ,Checking in Years Later,0

2212,I m pretty upset with her She smokes almost a pack every day She will spend minutes smoking two or three at a time I quit about a year ago and have not touched one since Actually I successfully quit times each for at least a few months I guess that doesn t really mean I was successful But living with a chain smoker is not easy She keeps promising to quit but doesn t even try She cuts back to quit but that only lasts a day or two She just got back from a trip with her family They do not smoke and they do not know she does She keeps it a secret from them The trip lasted days She promised that she would be done for good The very first thing she did as soon as she got back was buy a pack And honestly I knew that s exactly what she was going to do Apparently her aunt was a little mean to her on the trip So according to my wife her aunt is to blame And now once again she says the stress from work and dealing with Crohn s disease keep keep her smoking She also blames me because she says I can stress her out Honestly this might be a deal breaker for me We cannot afford her addiction I tell her this often But it doesn t change a thing I m worried about her long term health which could very well bankrupt us when she needs to be hospitalized or develops severe illnesses I don t want her to resent me I don t want to upset her I don t want to give her an ultimatum Those will only make her habit worse I asked her to seek help from doctors counselor or anything that will help her quit Nope Not going to happen I don t know what to do At this point I don t believe she will ever quit Most of her friends smoke and she hangs out with them a few times every week Thanks for listening ,How can I convince my wife to stop smoking ,0

2224,This is a huge accomplishment for me right now I have to celebrate the small steps I am on day with no cigarettes I ve smoked for years now about a half a pack a day if not more I had zero motivation to quit before but recently I noticed I had this persistent cough and throat clearing that just never went away and it totally freaked me out enough that I decided enough was enough I wanted to go cold Turkey but I knew it was going to be rough so I bought the step nicoderm patch with the lowest dose of mg and figured this will help with the symptoms It was definitely a lower dose than what my body was used to because I am still experiencing some withdrawal symptoms Day the urge to smoke was really strong I really wanted a cigarette in the evening but I stuck my patch on and got through it Definitely felt some restlessness at night Day today I began to feel slight flu like symptoms like head pressure and body aches twisting stomach sensation But the urge to smoke wasn t as bad Feeing like crap makes me not want to smoke more The anxiety is pretty high today too I feel like I want to go running miles just to help relieve the anxiousness I know I m in for for a rough couple more days but I know I can push through this If anyone has advice on how to get through the initial withdrawal symptoms I d love to hear it ,Day ,0

2226,Has anyone tried to cut smoking cold turkey during a dietary water fast I ve quit nicotine quite a few times on my journey years has been my best attempt so far I ve learned from my attempts that it s easier when I avoid other triggers addictions habits to gain willpower I spent the last month quitting weed and caffeine and the past few weeks I ve been going hard with yoga exercise breath work and meditation to feel like a new person and disturb my habitual ruts I know I can do this without fasting but I m wondering if that has helped anyone I could see it adding a bunch of extra stress on top of withdraws but maybe it would be more beneficial in ways like speeding up withdraw recovery I couldn t find any scientific literature on the subject with nicotine anyways but personally once I water fast for days I begin to feel amazing The first days of both fasting and nicotine withdraw are probably some of the hardest times I ve put myself thru but today I m beginning both as sort of an experiment to test my willpower and to see if helps I m in my last semester to become a Dietitian so I know quite a bit about diet fasting and overall health I have completed a lot of day water fasts so it s nothing new to me I ll give you guys an update when it feels right Since I didn t ween myself for a water fast like I usually do I probably wont go more than days ,Dietary fasting to curb withdraws ,0

2236,I cracked and bought a pack of tobacco I had managed a biblical total of days cigarette free On the plus side that was the longest I ve ever managed and I m determined I m not going to revert back to my former identity as a smoker now Severe loneliness and burnout and low mood definitely contributed to cracking I m isolated and my ADHD and depression has been kicking my arse lately along with coping with other life stressors but I think the main cause of caving was the fact that occasional vaping as part of nicotine reduction had crept up as a smoking substitute and I realised that the last few days I was actually consuming way more nicotine than as a smoker but without the unpleasant side effects of smoking and was therefore just swapping an identity as a smoker for one as a vaper when I had started out so strong with NRT I know a lot of folks here equate vaping with smoking but personally the main thing I needed to mentally overcome was the habit of smoking and the ability to deceive myself that I need to be a smoker But more importantly to learn to value myself as worth more than poisoning myself with these horrid things I ve had a seriously low week with depression and haven t been able to eat or sleep well at all I woke up early this morning and meditated and stretched and spent time with these feelings instead of avoiding them or beating myself up I m going to get through today with smokes and tonight the juul and the smokes are going in the bin Plan is to pick up where I left off tomorrow morning after a good night s sleep but with nicotine patches and by consciously cultivating the mindset I had days ago I had grown complacent in the quitting process Every cigarette I light smells and tastes absolutely foul and disgusting and makes me feel like a junkie I can t believe the insane exhaustion and brain fog the oxygen deprivation is causing me and yet I m sitting here thinking that I can solve the fuzziness with another cigarette I deserve better than that Yesterday I was a non smoker Tomorrow I will be again , days and I caved Pep talks cold hard truths amp tough love needed,0

2249, TL DR Quit because you want to not because someone tells you to amp x B Dear quitters of Reddit amp x B As someone who quit smoking four years ago today I want to share my insight and personal experience on what worked for me I am in no way a professional or a counselor or qualified to give advice I am just a person who has smoked for twelve years and decided on a Tuesday afternoon in October of that it was enough I haven t relapsed once and these days I don t even think about it anymore Except of course today because a reminder popped up an told me Four years smoke free today amp x B The idea of quitting had been in my mind for a while Not because my partner wanted me to quit or because I thought cigarettes were getting too expensive Not even because I worried that I could develop some nasty health issues when I got older amp x B I quit because I wanted to be free of my addiction And more specifically I wanted to be able to sit through an entire movie on Netflix without having to pause for a smoke amp x B amp x B Before I would always worry if I had enough cigarettes with me If the shops were still open If I could smoke at place X I used to think in smoke breaks as I m sure many of you can relate to Five minutes before a meeting Time for a cigarette Commercials on tv Smoke time A short walk to a bus stop Smoke time I didn t want to admit it but smoking cigarettes dominated my entire schedule It did so sneakily but it did so nonetheless If I spent two hours or more in a museum I wanted to get outside and smoke I didn t necessarily want to leave but my addiction was demanding my attention I couldn t concentrate on the beautiful art before me I was only thinking when can I smoke amp x B amp x B During withdrawal Did you know that people who quit smoking are often fighting more than one fight Of course you do amp x B You fight the withdrawal symptoms You fight the desire to smoke For some fighting against overeating as a substitute You struggle as your brain re adjusts itself to a life without cigarettes the habitual part the part where you don t know what to do with your hands amp x B There is a big difference between wanting to quit and being told to quit either by a person or a situation I wanted to quit so I didn t have to fight the desire to smoke I knew for a fact that I never wanted to light up a cigarette ever again A switch had flipped in my brain as clearly as if a light turned on in a room Now that did not make the withdrawal symptoms any less bad The nicotine receptors in my brain were as loud as they always were The thing that made it easier is that I was able to look beyond the initial withdrawal and focus on the after Withdrawal doesn t last forever it s a very real chemical process in your brain The nicotine receptors shrink after a while and you won t crave cigarettes anymore After that there is a calmer clearer mind amp x B So instead of thinking I can t smoke anymore I thought I ve quit smoking I am experiencing these withdrawal symptoms I feel like sh t but I know this won t last forever After this is over I will be free amp x B I would write it down whenever I was wide awake at AM restless irritated antsy grinding my teeth and unable to stay still In fact I wrote a lot in the deep dark hours of the night mostly just describing my feelings or record the time as it passed by amp x B amp x B After First and foremost I am not a saint Quitting smoking didn t miraculously heal all my problems and there are many things I struggle with I got problems but a smoke ain t one I am not the person who is going to tell you that you will feel amazing and fantastic and reborn No you will feel normal I feel normal And it s the best kind of normal I can imagine because smoking made me feel like a pariah I can exit any building I have been in for however many minutes and not reach for my cigarettes the moment I walk out I can make my coffee in the morning and snuggle up on the couch while looking at the downpour and not stand in it shivering with coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other I don t count in cigarettes anymore A meeting is now not in one cigarette but in five minutes I am no longer constantly thinking about it being inconvenienced by it distracted by it controlled by it I can spend hours in a museum and be amazed and fully focused on the beauty I see I can go to the cinema and stay in my seat during the break I feel normal amp x B amp x B In conclusion I encourage everyone to go and feel super normal I know everyone s situation is different and I am not here to tell you one method is wrong and the other is right I just want to shine some light on your motivation to quit smoking Because if the motivation comes from within you if you are the one who decides you can do it The fight won t be as difficult And it will be worth it to just not have to think about those stupid cigarettes anymore amp x B For me I chose a time in my life where I felt I wasn t under high stress and things were going relatively well No exams no lousy job I had just moved out on my own so I had the mental capacity to deal with the emotions So my advice will be quitting is good but quitting when you re ready is better ,I ve quit smoking four years ago today This is my advice ,0

2251, Smoking makes no sense at all It is unhelathy it is expensive it makes you stink Why would anyone want to smoke at all It is stressful When you re a smoker you always have to worry about having a lighter lighting up cigarette butts ash emptying ashtrays buying a pack having a pack opening windows during winter when your room stinks and it s all really a lot Once you quit it s all gone No smoking lifestyle is a healthy lifestyle Once you quit smoking you start to take care of your body as well You develop a healthy mindset For example I started to take a lot more vitamins than I used to and drink a lot more teas You simply choose what s good for you It s an achievement If you re a smoker who quit smoking you feel proud of yourself Like I really did that I managed to quit an addiction And you just feel better about yourself It s an huge ego boost and you start to see yourself as someone who is capable of anything You re calmer I was scared to quit smoking before because I thought What if I get even more angry and stressed without cigarettes Well I was wrong I feel a lot calmer weeks smoke free than before Turns out it was cigarettes that made me so stressed , weeks smoke free Observations,0
2252,Hey everyone I m going to give an account of my journey from smoking to changing over to vaping to quitting fully now just to say thanks for helping me quit smoking more than anything else ever did and probably saving my life in the process Hopefully this can give inspiration to others that want to quit and will give ideas on the methods I used that may work for someone else I ll start when I was in and started smoking My first pack was Marlboro menthol s the funny feeling of getting dizzy from smoking and thinking it was kind of cool continued for a bit until I was fully addicted and couldn t stop nor did I really want to I remember thinking after a few years that I wish I had never started as the person that got me into smoking had quit most of my friends that smoked had quit or at least only smoked when partying etc and here I was smoking all time and couldn t stop Well at least I never bought cartons right That was the point that would mean I was smoking too much at least that s what I rationalized in my head For years this went on switching from Marlboro Menthols to Camel Filters to Camel Crush to Camel Crush Bold then when they were banned I went to Camel Menthols At this point it had been years since I started smoking I had quit about or years into smoking for about months but I said to myself one day that i could just have a couple when drinking which progressed right back to full on smoking habit I was kicking myself because it was so miserable to quit cold turkey like i had and now I d have to go through it again if i was going to quit again which I thought I might never I had started buying cartons maybe a year or before the seven year mark something i never wanted to do Every paycheck I would buy a carton plus packs as I was smoking close to a pack a day I had tried vaping before this point with the little pen vapes that weren t very good or didn t last very long on battery I could never figure out how to get the lung hit that I needed and got whenever smoking a cigarette so I never stuck with the vaping If i was just going to feel like i was breathing flavored air then what was the point Like I said this was towards the beginning of when vaping was becoming a thing I tried to be one of the earliest adopters but it didn t work for me At around years I was starting to wake up and not be able to take full breaths until like or minutes after waking up My lungs were hurting every morning and I knew my smoking days had to come to an end as this was definitely not good It legitimately scared me feeling like that every couple mornings for about months That s when a coworker at the time who i would smoke with on smoke breaks got big into vaping I mean went off the deep end on all the tech different tanks and atomizers making his own coils all that kind of stuff This was also right at the beginning of box mods becoming popular so that was a plus for me since the pen batteries only had maybe a hour battery life for me and wouldn t get me all the way through work He started showing me a bunch of this stuff and I headed to a vape shop with him to see all the different things i could try after trying his tank and box mod setup that made a lot more vapor than the pens too In the end I ended up picking up a Sigelei w box mod https imgur com a vAwFKeo https imgur com a vAwFKeo and a Kanger subtank https imgur com a h KJwL https imgur com a h KJwL I was originally using or mg nicotine juice and paid attention while smoking cigs to see what it felt like with air flow lung hit feel etc I found that cutting the airflow almost completely off to where it felt like i was dragging on a cig and having the high nicotine content and a dual coil at w to give the harsh lung hit was exactly what I was looking for I was smoking and vaping for months still holding onto the cigs until I noticed one day that I was picking the vape over the cigs more and more often because it tasted better and specifically remember being at work on a smoke break and smoking a quarter of a cig and throwing it out I thought at that point why are you still smoking these things you re throwing most of it away it is a waste of money now That is when I went on to vape completely I believe this was The years go by still only vaping still using mg as was kind of phased out of use in the whole industry it seemed and was satisfied Whenever i had a cig at a party or something every months or so it would taste terrible and I d toss it after only a few puffs I had the Sigelei w temperature control https imgur com a Be b cq https imgur com a Be b cq by then still the same Kanger tank https imgur com a h KJwL https imgur com a h KJwL with the dual coils not using the temperature function at all just the same w as usual I remember other vapers commenting they couldn t believe i still had that setup still like it was an antique or something haha Well around the end I believe I could not find coils for the tank anymore and the box mod was pretty beat up too so I went to the local bigger vape shop and asked about what was good nowadays as I never took it on as a hobby and had no idea what kind of tech was out there now for box mods and tanks The guy behind the counter was using a Voopoo Drag https imgur com a Qp xzZ https imgur com a Qp xzZ and a Freemax Mesh Pro tank https imgur com a xg AuG https imgur com a xg AuG I bought those for my new setup and was happy with it The mesh helped get an instant hit like if you were hitting a cig plus setting it up the same way with the airflow almost closed off got that cig feel and i was good to go I was a little worried i d lose that feel with a new setup and go back to smoking So now we get to the end of Keep in mind that I had been ordering my coils and juice online for years from giantvapes and hadn t had to deal with the hassle of going to a store for anything other than that new setup Here comes Trump s dumbass vape mail ban I couldn t believe it I bought what I could until I couldn t order anymore and hoped to see how that would hold me but I knew the end of vaping was coming for me I wasn t going to pay double the price for stuff in a physical store That ended up not being the case but i was sure it would be that way as it used to be for a ml bottle back in the day from a store and half that online This shows you how long it had been since i had gone into a physical store lol I finished my last bit of mg after a couple months and decided to try to start to ween myself off nicotine if i could This never worked before with cigs and I always had the experience of not getting the lung hit with lesser nicotine juice but i thought i would try it So I dropped to mg and i was shocked to find it still had a lung hit Maybe not as hard but I was used to it after a few days and I was good to go After I ran out of mg a couple months later I dropped to mg for a couple months with the same effect got used to the hit after a couple days and it was fine This whole time I had not craved for more nicotine nor was I vaping any more than I used to which was a pleasant surprise even though I pretty much vaped constantly anyways Now we get to about months ago I was taking the last big step and buying mg nicotine juice after not being without nicotine for about years I guess because i had stepped down to mg and was still able to vape to satisfy the habit mental part of it i had nearly NO WITHDRAWALS It was amazing the only affect i had was a little irritation and foggy headedness the first day but after that it was like nothing happened I didn t crave it because I was still vaping so it was nothing like when i quit cold turkey The only issue was that now with mg nicotine it really did feel like there was no lung hit anymore like i was just breathing flavored air again and I worried about going back to the nicotine juice again and getting dependent on nicotine again I just puffed harder to get what little lung hit mg has and I kicked the nicotine Now we re to about a week ago and not getting the lung hit is starting to annoy me I had the realization that I m not enjoying this anymore as I m expecting to get that lung hit and getting disappointed every time I vape once again the flavored air what s the point thing So I said screw it and dropped it all together I have taken a couple puffs since a week ago but that is it I ve pretty much quit altogether I never thought I would quit vaping as it is safe and I enjoy the act of smoking so why would I quit Well the mail ban and not wanting to be addicted to something anymore has finally made it a pain in the ass enough where i m done with it No more sneaking puffs indoors somewhere because it s not allowed there No more going outside in the rain or freezing cold or sweltering heat at work to get puffs because i NEED it No more making a nasty film on the inside of the glass in my car because the vape condenses on them and it s a bitch to clean off No more dreading flying on a plane because from the time you get into the airport until the time you re out of your destination airport there s basically nowhere to vape smoke and I vaped smoked like a chimney And no more coughing in the morning even though vaping is safe it would still condense on the inside of my lungs and make me cough some in the morning and throughout the day My entire adult life I ve needed nicotine to make it by always having to plan ahead to make sure I had enough cigs or juice to make it through to when i could buy more or being broke in my early adult years and spending money on cigs rather than food because I couldn t be without it I keep looking over to grab my vape and walk outside out of habit then I remember I dont need that anymore it s not even with me I have literally stood up at work and paced around the office thinking it felt weird that I hadn t gone outside for a vape yet It s like it s all totally new for me I haven t not done these things since I was in high school and it feels great Anyways the point to all this is just to share with people that understand what I went through as most of us have to some degree had a similar story I think and to share a story that may help more of you make that transition from smoking to vaping using the way i set up the vape to make it feel like a cigarette or from vaping to fully quitting if you choose I was on mg nicotine for god s sake most vapers couldn t even hit my vape because it would give them coughing fits from how strong it was If I can do it you definitely can cliche I know but try it out the way I did and it may work for you Those of you that are continuing to vape no shade thrown towards you either If it wasn t banned from getting supplies mailed to me I d probably still be vaping and I definitely loved having a way to smoke without risking cancer stinking of cig smoke etc I m thankful that vaping got me off cigs which I don t think I could ve done myself and it pisses me off to no end that it is demonized when it has saved so many lives myself included It didn t matter that I saw my great uncle without a nose because he had to have it removed because of smoking It didn t matter seeing those commercials with the guy with the hole in his throat or any of that stuff Vaping was finally the thing that worked and after all these years I can say I m free to join the people I started smoking with all those years ago that quit as well Thanks for all the help over the years on this subreddit and encouragement I wish you all the best and with any luck this will by my last goodbye to this sub Be excellent to each other PS Don t look at my number of days that I have been quit on this sub that was set when I quit cold turkey the first time you can see how long ago that was Took me until now to be able to do it again but dammit i m doing it Never again going back to it ,My Journey Saying Goodbye for good this time ,0
2253,After hours of struggle some weird surreal feelings there I woke up this morning relaxed and peaceful I couldn t believe it since I was expecting quite the opposite Anyway the cravings appeared shortly Whenever that happens I have my anti smoking prescription ready Look at a very disturbing image smoking related Someone who s very sick or someone who has passed away because of tobacco consumption Sometimes PAIN is a better motivator than pleasure I read several times my personal list of reasons why I should never smoke again I meditate for a couple of minutes and observe how irrational all these thoughts are All caused from a sick addiction E x I will never enjoy my vacation again How can I drink my coffee now Will I ever be relaxed again This is bullsh t and seeing it written also makes me laugh LoL What is your prescription Thank you very much for reading and for your continues support Let s do it ,Diary of a Non Smoker DAY Little moments of peace ,0

2258,I ve been having a few drinks with the family smoking as usual Thought it would be fun get the camcorder out the attic because who doesn t love clingy moments from the early s We have supposedly already seen every single video possible yet I find one labeled name and name So I think cool that ll be funny and pop it on Fast forward through cringy ass singing at age we stumble upon unseen footage of life how it used to be I was smoking swearing and trying to live up to the people around me I was sat at the kitchen dining table holding a role up in each hand and smoking both It was at this point I realised as an adult that I was disgusted with myself I was a child back then and I should of had better parental care but I know my mum had just came out of a really bad domestic violence relationship so I kinda don t blame her for being so withdrawn I mean I don t know personally what that is like to be beat up for years I have two kids and I ve stopped smoking various times of course whilst pregnant months after having my kids I d pick the habit up whilst stressed then I quit again and the cycle would continue I watched that video as a parent and thought to myself I d that was my kid this would NOT be happening So it s now am when I wake up a little later I m banging a patch on and going for it that home video has been the ultimate wake up call for me because of the different levels of disgust I feel Sorry for the essay but I needed to get it out as to why ,when you have that moment of realisation,0
2259,In my past attempts I have made it a month without quite a few times That s always been with vaping and willpower or patches and willpower This time I decided to go with the Allen Carr easyway and I will say it has helped me more than anything else However as much as I obviously don t wanna smoke ever again there s a part of me that wants to do nothing more than go smoke I still feel like I m giving something up If anybody has felt similar after using the Allen Carr method how have you gotten past this I m afraid that I m slowly turning into a willpower quitter and not an easyway non smoker In turn that makes me feel like I m going to relapse and it s only a matter of time until I do ,In four hours I will be five days without any nicotine But I m still glamorizing it,0

2266,For the last ten years or so I ve been noticing my hair thinning BTW I am female Sometimes during a shower and washing my hair I would literally have to use my foot to push the hair off the drain for the water to flow out I blamed it on some medication I was taking and since doctors are supposed to report side effects of prescribed medications I even insisted that he report it to the manufacturer About a week ago there has been much less hair in the drain This morning I noticed practically none I was perplexed I m still taking the medication Why the sudden turnaround What am I doing differently And then it occurred to me the only thing I m doing differently is NOT SMOKING What do you guys think I know we get more blood supply to all our cells and consequently more oxygen too when we quit but damn It never crossed my mind that it could be cigarettes Yet another reason to stay quit Especially for those of us who are vain Anybody else noticed a difference If not maybe be on the lookout ,Holy Cows I just realized something ,0

2276,Hi everybody I hope you re all doing well Today marks the th day without smoking cigarettes for me This is the longest I ve been in over year and months I m y old and university student This is going to be a long post and I m sorry in advance I d been a smoker for years but with a vacation off cigarettes for couple of months where I would smoke one or two here and there but that was it Throughout my smoking career I was increasing how much I smoke during the day throughout those years In the end I would smoke pack and sometimes even and a half or maybe when I was stressed I realize that years may seem like nothing but believe me I was a smoker like anyone else with a longer cigarette smoking history behind My day was built around cancer sticks they were the first thing for me in the morning and the last thing before going to bed I would go freezing myself on the balcony in the winter to smoke and I would go in the middle of the night to buy a pack on the machine because tobacco shops didn t work at am This was all just a sign that I was ADDICTED TO A DRUG Being addicted isn t fun at all Problem is that some smokers don t even want to accept the fact that they are addicted they think they like smoking but that s just a trick their brain is playing on them I quit with the help of mg Nicorette patch Without it I would have never quit I just don t have that strong of a willpower to quit without NRT I ve tired gum and lozenges but I threw up because of the taste and how much I just didn t like them so I decided to get the patches The biggest thing I noticed is how much more free time I have now I can finally dedicate myself to playing video games that I really love and not playing for hour and then craving for a cigarette I can drink coffee and actually spend time with it talking to persons around me and not craving for anything I ll buy a book to read in my free time as well and I ll study more to finish the last couple of exams I have left to graduate My biggest motivators to quit were my financial situation I truly believe that every person should be a better human being to himself herself and to his family and people who he or she loves I didn t want my mom and gran to spend money to buy me cigarettes and not have enough for other things I also wanted to do things I love like gaming and reading and watching things without constantly being bothered for a smoke I also didn t want to be anxious when I don t have enough cigarettes for the day And many other things I plan to gradually reduce the strenght of the patches within the next few weeks and finally get off them as well I always take them off before going to sleep and I don t have any issues During the first few days with the patches I noticed that my skin where the patch is would itch but that would pass within few minutes so not that big of a deal I encourage all to quit using any method you may need or you may find suitable My psychatrist told me not to quit cold turkey so I didn t and I couldn t have done it that way Sorry for the long post I just wanted to share my story and hold myself accountable P S I still think about smoking and romanticize it but I hope I don t cave in All the best to all , th day without cigarettes ,0

2278,I m smoke about cigarettes a day and have done so for the last months I m capable of not smoking any for days and I do so regularly to kind of keep a bit of control It s really easy for me to not smoke on normal days but if there s a party or I m going to a club I really have trouble Like atleast half the people there smoke and when I m drunk I obviously think less clearly I also enjoy the smoking in those situations cause it gives me a chance to go outside for a bit and think for a minute When I m going out I usually smoke about a night Any advice ,How do I stop smoking at parties ,0
2279,I ve been a smoker for years and some to cigarettes a day I ve tried quitting times cold turkey vaping patches and nicotine candies The longest I went without smoking were and months using a vape I m currently months pregnant down to to cigarettes a day and desperate about ever quitting I m in a very poor mental state due to the guilt and worry of smoking while pregnant and perpetual anxiety because of the stigma even though you d guess I m trying to hide it I ve been actively trying to stop since I got pregnant but with no success I couldn t get past h so far I ve seen a midwife that specializes in addiction and got prescribed patches and candies but they re the lowest possible dosage and don t really bring down the urges beside a psychological effect I hate the candies too and will switch to gums on my next try At this point I kind of gave up on the pregnancy motivator since I ve been smoking for the past full months but I can t stomach that I ll still be smoking when my baby is born This is disheartening to me I don t give up on trying but I need to plan my next attempt so that I m not immediately overwhelmed by the cravings I can manage to avoid the cigarettes that I usually smoke throughout the day but some are so deeply rooted in my habits and routines that I ve the hardest time to fight back The first cigarette of the morning that I have with coffee after breakfast is a big one Then the one after lunch Then the one after dinner Then I get the worst cravings in the evening and especially after I ve put my son to bed and I m able to lay back and relax My husband is a heavy smoker too and this is usually a time when we sit in the garden and chat and smoke I easily smoke half a day worth of cigarettes there in one sitting over a couple hours before going to bed The association between that moment and smoking is so strong I don t know how to fight it This is where all previous attempts have failed I take any advice to help me change things around and support my efforts ,Dealing with routines associations and cravings ,0

2296,I thought I would create a post about the symptoms I experienced since I have quit smoking I Hopes that it will help a fellow ex smoker make sense of their nicotine withdrawal symptom s or help a smoker understand what they could expect after quitting Today I am days smoke free and still going strong First days were pretty tough I had mild tremors and double vision accompanied by somewhat bearable headaches that would come and go throughout the day Of course agitation was high on the list with my anxiety also being particularly problematic This was soon followed by excessive mucus down the nasal passage which I did my best to spit out when I was able to but when I wasn t able to it contributed to congestion and inflammation in the chest which ultimately felt similar to a chest cold For that I bought an over the counter bronchodilator syrup which was a great relief and helped get rid of the congestion pretty quickly A big bowl of chicken soup also helps heaps By the end of my first week I started bloating quite a bit and experienced gastro symptoms passing larger and more frequent stools This lasted for the following two weeks and I did make a point of not falling prey to eating more To help with the stomach issues I started eating cleaner more veg and probiotics which seemed to settle the stomach issues and the bloating subsided completely after two weeks The purpose of this post is to help others who are either wanting to quit smoking to understand what they COULD experience or those who have recently quit make sense of their symptoms side effects We won t all experience the same symptoms side effects but I think it is worth a shot to share our post quitting experiences because the internet is not always a great help I hope this helps someone if you are having any questions please ask and I will do my best to assist x,Symptoms side effects of nicotine withdrawal,0

2312,I started smoking when I was now after like one or two years I was on pack a day It was too much money for me so I started to buy tobacco to roll which is a little cheaper and more tasty option in my country But man at one point I was able to smoke the whole tobacco pack in a day which is i think g thats like cigs a day Basicly i had that fucking thing in my mouth all day Arround yo I started to feel the negative impact big trouble with breathing headaches insomnia occasionall heart disrythmia which scares me the most weird pressure etc I went from smoking to nicotine pouches and I started to feel much better after couple of days but now it is back for like half a year so I want to quit for good At one point because I am working on a ship I wasnt able to buy new pouches for cca days So I was just using the used ones all the time which turned out to have a very good placebo effect The th day I realised that I dont feel any cravings anymore Unfortunately I didnt plan to quit at that time so I didnt grab that oportunity and bought a new ones and basically started again Fucking idiot But what came to my mind now is that Because Im addicted to it so hard that when I tried cold turkey it just didnt seem possible Maybe its a good idea to try this placebo strategy So tomorrow is my first day I hope it will work ,Im quitting tomorrow,0

2321,Hey guys So I m about weeks into my quit I used hypnotherapy and it was very helpful I have started running which is a pure joy for me it s producing some great chemicals I feel like my body is well adjusted now and yet I do also have some pretty intense stressors in my life I also love to consume media in the form of movies and there is A LOT OF SMOKING shown in these films shows So after not having any cravings for the first two three weeks now I m kinda seeing them resurface I also have work family general life stress and I m just still hanging on for dear life you know I guess I m surprised to find that the cravings can still surface after this length of time because after the hypnotherapy I felt so solid in my decision I even somewhat became nauseous at the thought of it which like yes it is nausea inducing it s quite sickening really Sigh Thanks so much for reading Wish me luck and continued success everyone , month in,0

2324,Today is Day for me And a very proud Day for my husband Things are getting easier There have been a couple days this week that I ve managed to go hours without thinking about a smoke instead of fighting a craving every hour The cravings are weaker and easier to distract myself from I m still struggling some with sleep I ve been feeling kind of zombie ish the last week Tired and bloated and like I ve got a bit of a head cold My anxiety and agitation are both on the intense side but my mood swings are calming down Mostly it just feels good though Every crappy day has still been better than a day spent smoking I particularly am coming to love Not feeling like I have to smoke before I can go anywhere do anything I ve mentioned this a few times on here but oh my god it s so annoying how everrryyyythingggggg starts being structured around cigarettes And it makes anything you need to do feel like a massive chore Even simple stuff Ugh gotta go CHECK THE MAILBOX Guess I ll have a cig first And one after Like what Just walk thirty feet and grab the mail it s not a hardship that you need cigarettes to get through Not having to shower every time I leave the house to avoid smelling too much like smoke Now I don t smell like smoke because I don t smoke anymore That s pretty great Not feeling like a loser every time my bonus kid is over and I miss time with them to step out on the porch and get my fix Or feeling like a loser when they come outside with me to spend time and have to breathe my secondhand smoke I don t wanna do that to my kid Looking healthier in general My teeth already look so much better I don t know how that s possible in weeks but they already look brighter So do my eyes My skin is a pimply mess right now but I know that ll go away too in a week or so Feeling healthier in general Deep breaths come more easily and I haven t noticed my heart racing pounding as often My stamina is already starting to improve a bit and I feel less winded during activities I m sure there are other positives I haven t mentioned but these are the big ones for me right now And I know they ll only get better as time goes ,Day ,0

2331,I ve been smoking consistently now for around years I ve been taking steps to quit for a few months now and it s been going better recently I was up to smoking about cigarettes a day That may not seem like a lot to some but it started feeling like a lot to me which I wonder if body size has anything to do with I m about lbs and The minimum I ve been able to get to per day has been about cigarettes and the maximum number of days I seem to be able to reach without smoking at all has been over the last few months During the days I am not smoking I ve basically learned to expect having lots of really really depressed feelings I don t seem to have any other withdrawal symptoms that I notice but it s really tough to go through the constant struggle to not have racing thoughts and depression I d love to be able to get on meds for the depression but I cannot afford them I think they would help a lot so it s something I may try to prioritize more I am also in counseling and quitting smoking has been an ongoing topic with my therapist but honestly it hasn t helped I feel that it only makes me feel more guilty and it loads on more stress because I feel more pressured to quit for someone else Not for me I think my main problem is that I don t enjoy life in general so I don t see a way that life would necessarily get better without smoking only that I wouldn t have to live with the fears and other things that accompany smoking Hopefully this subreddit will be an encouragement to me ,First post here,0
2332,Hey r stopsmoking yesterday I was at the pulmologist with my mother and as expected she got bad news She s smoking since her youth and the effects are getting bigger I wasn t shocked when the doctor told her she has COPD Her lung is wounded and she can t walk like meters without almost passing out The disappointing part is that she is not able to stop smoking It s a topic we had for years Part of why I stopped smoking half a year ago after years was to be an example for her But she blocks every way I try to help her My next try will be like a Presentation for her I will show her in detail but as easy as I can what COPD is and what a difference it would make to stop smoking She really has her problems to understand the topic and I want to give her the chance to understand it If she still don t want to stop smoking then I will atleast have tried my best I have to tell you it s not easy to see your own mother slowly dying That s why I won t ever give up fighting for her life I encourage everybody to try to stop smoking I don t want to mention the bad effects of smoking but I want you to see the chances of stopping I stopped month days and hours ago and I don t regret it It s the first time I had a success in my life where I am proud of every day that I reached it I am more into sports since I stopped I soon stopped coughing and now I only cough like normal people I don t have the bad smell and I save alot of money The biggest point is that I enjoy to breathe now Non smoking has only benefits I had some hard moments since I quit but I never needed a cigarette because I knew that it will cause problems than solving them Nobody s perfect and I didn t succeed in my first try but this time although I m an absolute pessimist I m safe to say that I ll never smoke again By the way Think about your loved ones I always hated it when friends said that I should stop smoking But they just had the need to tell me this because the didn t want me to die early I hope this post can help For me it was a help to write down my thoughts ,Mom got diagnosed with COPD,0
2333,I had a realization tonight I ve listened to the recording of Allen Carr s book Easy Way to Stop Smoking at least a dozen times now and although the idea usually sticks for a while I ve cracked and smoked each time And it s always a bummer Anyway I read a comment on here once which said something along the lines of I m a nonsmoker now I don t smoke I don t want to smoke If a meteor were headed for Earth to kill us all I still wouldn t smoke And that last line always stuck with me I mean if a god damn meteor were about to kill us all fuck it right Smoke up And despite listening to that damn book over and over to make sure I fully understood every point and counter argument to the shit my brain would come up with to justify smoking I still never could get over that meteor thing Because deep down I still believed it was actually an enjoyable experience to smoke and relieve my nicotine withdrawals Which basically meant I d never really gotten the point of that damn book lol I don t want to smoke I don t ever want to smoke again And I m pretty I never wanted to smoke in the first place except for those first few experimental times What I want is to not want to smoke Does that make sense And for most of my life the only way to get rid of that craving urge to smoke was to just smoke Yet the sick joke is that smoking is what perpetuates the eternal hell of always wanting to smoke I don t want to smoke I want to not want to smoke and I do that by not smoking Every time I think I want a cigarette I realize no I don t want a cigarette I am having a trigger craving urge to do what I ve always done But that has not worked and it will not ever work I want to be free of this hellish nightmare of suffering feelings of withdrawal followed by feeling guilty for caving in And I do that by not smoking And every day the nicotine leaves my body a bit more and every day I train myself to react to triggers by not wanting to pursue that damned strategy I fooled myself into relying on And to that end it s a relief to realize that as long as I ve got my head screwed on right I won t ever fall for the trick again Not tomorrow and not next year because if I plan on smoking again one day to throw out all logic and self preservation for a phantom of relief then I might as well do it this very moment Logical fallacies have a way of immediately collapsing the entire framework like that I get it now I don t want to smoke I never want to smoke Gun to my head meteor headed right for the Earth that sucks but suggesting I smoke a cigarette is just as dumb of an idea as suggesting I shoot up heroin or bash my toe with hammer ,It s easier to quit when you know it s for good,0

2335,I m much farther along into smoking than I ever wanted or anticipated being My parent was a smoker abusive and has been dead I always used weed to get away from nicotine and now it s the only way I ve been having weed for quite a long long while now daily Quitting Cold Turkey is going to be difficult although I don t have a massive amount of tobacco daily I am a small individual I want to be a mother one day and every day that I smoked has kept me farther from that and has distanced me from my fianc I have a vape that s heavy on CBD low THC so that if I do get any shakes or irritability it ll take the risky edge of it off hopefully I just can t anymore I haven t had any genuine enjoyment out of smoking for a long time and it s made my GERD reoccur so so much worse as well in spite of my consistent love of garlic and probiotics ,Here We Go ,0

2337,I started smoking in college while I was also working a weekend job My work had a lot of down time so almost everyone in the warehouse would sit around chain smoking They would smoke in the trucks and at our delivery sites Eventually it became too tempting and to relieve stress from work and school I began smoking as well At first it was just cigarillos I would smoke one in the morning before class They used to sell flavored cigarillos which made it easier to get into Then one day I ran out so I bummed a smoke from someone on campus I realized they weren t as bad I thought they would be and they were cheaper so I started buying those instead Then it turned into a social thing Hanging out with the other guys between class at the smoke pit and shooting the shit Smoking in a circle in the warehouse with the other guys at work before our next delivery Some of my other friends had started smoking as well so I would smoke a lot at parties One cigarillo in the morning turned into about smokes a day I still lived at home and had to hide it from my parents I m not sure how they couldn t smell it when I came home but I managed to hide it One time they found an empty pack in my car and called me out on it I said I had smoked some but had quit already which was a lie Then I kept smoking in secret I knew it was an addiction Eventually the guys in my class started switching to vapes This was in the somewhat early days of vaping around I picked up a cheap vape and found it was actually pretty easy to switch from cigarettes to the vape The vape tasted better and at the time juice was pretty cheap It was easier to hide and I could vape inside I never smoked inside or in my car The cheap vape turned into sub ohm mods DIY coil wrapping and bigger and bigger bottles of juice It got more and more expensive I didn t do the math but it might have been more expensive than smoking Occasionally I would go back to smokes when I ran out of juice but could switch back to the vape pretty easily It came to a point where I knew I couldn t keep vaping But quitting vaping was incredibly hard I tried and failed a dozen times Vaping was too easy and too convenient and I couldn t resist it I made a promise years ago that I would stop vaping I failed but kept it a secret I hid it from the person I promised it to The second time I lied and hid my addiction from someone close to me I feel an immense amount of guilt for hiding it for so long My last vape was weeks ago and while I have constant cravings I ve resisted so far I m doing NRT right now and it s helping It feels weird to say but I miss standing out in the rain having a lonely smoke I hope that feeling goes away eventually I can t share my weeks of progress with anyone else since I supposedly quit years ago So I m posting it here to get it off my chest Thanks for reading , years of smoking years of vaping weeks since quitting,0

2341,About years ago my wife and I started daily smoking MJ and mixing in tobacco was common but not daily Sometimes we did sometimes we didn t For the past almost years I ve had monthly anxiety attacks that are crippling and just downright horrible The process I d have a moment where I d get this weird nervous aura followed by anxiety a hot flash shaking sweats and general confusion about my current situation Everything would stop in under a minute except the shaking and anxiety The shaking would slow itself down after a while but the crippling anxiety would last days For a year and a half I thought I was having issues with depression and the fear of having another attack was almost just as bad It happened every month almost to the day with a few times it skipping a month or being slightly later in the month but it was still consistent After multiple changes of diet and other daily routines and having no luck it finally hit me I was mixing in way too much tobacco and having it way too often and when I was having my attacks it was when I wasn t having any tobacco at all Basically withdrawal effects from not using I ve quit tobacco for months now and while the recurring anxiety attacks have happened they were much less in intensity and there was no physical lasting affects Each month has gotten better Anyone else with similar stories ,Once a month anxiety for almost years,0

2348,So smoking is bad No shit But it took me years to make me wanna quit The main reason that left me to the decision was my mental helth See smoking doesnt reduce my anxiety it reduces the nicotine stress I used my ciggarettes to damp my stress but in reality it only releaves my nicotine stress Meditation is way better att calming nerves Im on day of being smoke free I have no patience i could fight anybody looking at med for too long at the street and i feel soo tired i dont know why The urges of smoking a ciggarette keep popping up in my head every min I just picture myself a life without ciggaretes and think to myself why couldnt that be this life Also i need to safe money and i really really wanna get rid of the anxiety ciggarettes come with As soon as the urges come i either eat alot of candy or i google up reasons why smoking is bad I really dont care about dying it honestly the opposit I just dont want live my life with all this stress ciggarettes give me I also draw tons of squares on a paper and now i have crossed of them having every th square withholding a prize like haircut or new pair of clothing I wish you look and i remember ciggarettes doesnt kill your pain It makes it worse If you gonna quit in years why not quit now ,How to pass day one,0
2349,I ve been smoking for about years averaging between sticks a day and this is my fifth attempt at quitting Attempt lasted months attempt around months Attempts and weren t very impressive in all those attempts I began my first smoke free day after chucking out all my cigarettes and lighters and I ultimately relapsed what struck me now is that while I had successfully removed enablers in my previous attempts i had never really worked on my own will power to deny the nicotine urge so this time I quit but with my ciggies all as it were on Sep th when I smoked my last cigarette in this quit attempt I still have an open pack of cigarettes meters away on the table and if I wanted to I could light up within seconds in my WFH desk I have six packs lying unopened still this was part of my routine buy smokes over the weekend to last the entire coming week I still have back up packs stashed everywhere car wardrobe drawers work laptop bag desk in office etc these were emergency packs in case I ran out in the course of normal life I still also have my other emergency they may announce a new lockdown stash in my under mattress storage that s about another packs I guess all these riches are at arm s length and while these days have not been easy at all denying that next cigarette has been simply so much more satisfying taking it one day at a time though here s to walking through this day without succumbing ,Day Hard mode Cold Turkey fingers still crossed ,0

2354,Hi everyone Longtime lurker but finally found the courage to post here Guys I need advice I m trying to quit smoking for around a year now after I reduced it to only weekends Smoked around half a pack a day for years I m always doing fine for a few weeks until social gatherings happen A lot of my friends are heavy smokers and I get jealous all the time just looking at them smoking Usually there is also quite a lot alcohol involved but even if I don t drink I can t do it Most of the times I can fight the urge to smoke for around an hour or so but then I give in How do you deal with such situations How can I break up this cigarette alcohol link in my brain Thanks in advance ,Week one AGAIN Any tips for dealing with alcohol smoking social events ,0
2355,Been on the fence about quitting for a while All the mental physical and economical benefits of not smoking aside there s something soothing about smoking that really calms me and I guess I m a little afraid of letting that go Been smoking for about years and I really don t want to quit but I decided that with the way the world is going there s less and less space for smokers in it Imagine being on holiday somewhere nice You find a great looking cozy bar and they serve you a delicious cold beer the sun is out and everything is perfect You ask for an ashtray and are told that it s a non smoking facility and you need to go behind that building on the other side of the street without your drink to have a cigarette One of my reasons for wanting to quit this habit is to avoid the imagined scenario above I remember when they banned indoor smoking in clubs restaurants many years ago I was furious at the time but it only took a little while until it became the accepted norm And now even as a smoker I would not like to see indoor smoking making a return I decided to seek medical help to make the process easier on me My doctor prescribed Champix which is a week treatment I m now on day and much to my big surprise it took over two hours this morning even after a couple of cups of coffee before I realized that I d forgotten to smoke The cravings simply weren t there as they use to be It is advised to continue to smoke while taking the pills for the first half as eventually smoking will induce nausea which will hopefully help with the psychological addiction Why am I writing all of this No idea Guess I m just trying to put some thoughts down somewhere and this felt like an appropriate place to do so ,My turn Stoptober ,0
2356,I quit vaping in June I smoked cigarettes for years and then vaped for like years I ve quit so many times but this year it was for good I read Alan Carr s How to Stop Smoking the Easy Way and haven t looked back There are SO many benefits to being nicotine free that I ve been learning about every since I quit This one really takes the cake though I used to have really bad insomnia Like some nights I just wouldn t be able to fall asleep for hours There were times I actually had to call out of work because it wasn t safe for me to drive on hours of sleep I experienced insomnia at least once a week sometimes more The doctor wouldn t prescribe sleeping medication and recommended I take melatonin or benadryl before bed both of which did next to nothing for me So I was just kind of SOL for a long time Two weeks after quitting nicotine I stopped having trouble falling asleep every night It s MAGICAL getting in the bed and just falling asleep I rarely have any issues falling asleep now If I ve had a stressful day maybe it takes me minutes to fall asleep instead of It s such a radical change in such a short amount of time Has anyone else noticed big changes in their sleep too ,Unexpected benefit,0

2412,Hey guys just wanted to post a celebration post I don t remember my exact quit date but I think it might have been st of september that makes me month and days off nicotine I m using patches originally mg that was way too high tbh so I ve just gone down to mg expecting to feel slightly off for the next few days Proud of myself because I knew cold turkey was too scary for me I have tried a few times but usually relapsed at weeks due to depression but I still haven t put a cigarette in my mouth for a whole month apart from one slip which I don t count as a relapse cos I didn t feel the need to continue I just continued putting the patches on the following days the patch helps a lot and I ve had very little cravings even hanging around other smokers defo need to shake up my social circle tho so I am around less people who could trigger me as I ween off patches too I m going to start lowering my patch strength come halloween so the end of this month I ll go mg for weeks and then mg for weeks I m expecting it to be tough but I ve been using this month to break the lifestyle addiction and learn as much about quitting as I can and strengthening my resolve I haven t been a smoker for long only about a year and a half so I know I should quit sooner rather than later as I m just making it harder for future me and I don t see a future for myself where I continue smoking my lungs were already feeling it and I struggled to run km where I was previously a super sporty person I think what has helped my recovery is I m not just quitting smoking I m building up my whole life replacing bad habits with good ones etc finding things to look forward to making huge changes eg I started a new job been going to the gym for zumba classes yoga I started brazillian jiu jitsu I m looking at other hobbies and classes to try and theres a board game club I ll be going to on saturdays I have spent a lot of time thinking about my future and what I want and I even have a mild career path direction and once I m at my next job in a few months in warehouse right now plan to move to office work I ll have my evenings free and more stuff to do cos that s what I need I smoked cos I was depressed cos my life sucked so I m making my life a good one Anyway this is turning into a ramble just wanted to join the conversation and share my own thoughts and experiences so far Cheers , month free using patches,0

2466,Good morning everyone My name is M gane I am living in Paris I am and I have been a smoker for years with a year break I started smoking again a year ago and it was the most stupid decision I took Now I am stuck with this addiction and no matter how much I try I cannot quit again So I am kind of desperate I want to quit smoking more than anything but every time the craving hits I forget all the reasons I wanted to quit before and all I can think about is I want to smoke and before I know it I went to buy another pack and I am smoking and I am back at square one feeling disappointment sadness despair and disgust What can I do I am reading this because I want to try again one last time but I want to do it right ,Looking for help,0
2467,This is the longest I ve gone without a dart since back when I was just a social smoker I feel amazing I m happy I m exercising regularly the house has never been cleaner I feel like I able to devote more energy to things I would usually put off I ve got savings for the first time in what feels like ages I can run k without feeling exhausted I m just hoping that I can keep this up I d failed quitting about times in a row before this attempt I would buy a pack smoke one then run it under the taps in frustration I didn t think this was going to be a successful attempt The first three days were shit Felt like smashing my head into a wall Nearly cracked every single day even to the extent of going to the shops and then dragging my sorry addict self back home without buying anything It was so rough I couldn t possibly have imagined that this attempt at quitting would be one that would last this long I m glad I persisted The next week after was much easier The I want to die and the I can t function without a cigarette cravings became more manageable What was in their place though was the wouldn t it be nice if you had a smoke right now thoughts They re so subtle seemingly so sensible that they re almost convincing You only realise through time that they re just as much part of the addiction as the withdrawals are Around this time I started exercising at first short walks then small body weight exercises By week I was running and lifting weights If there was one thing that stopped me from smoking in that time it was that You get excited about how much you can lift and how far you can run the next day Instead of sitting in bed at night thinking about the morning dart you re planning out the route you re going to ride The thought of ruining the progress of my exercise and awful thought of having to go through the heavy withdrawals again kept me honest I haven t left nicotine behind me yet I feel like it might be months before I can say that I ve truly beaten the addiction Day to day I don t really have any cravings but there s still the odd thought of smoking every now and again I definitely still get cravings when I drink so I ve learned to stay away from alcohol or drink light beer so that it s a little more manageable But I m hopeful this is going to continue I m looking forward to writing my month post To those who gave me advice and support through the tough times thank you To those going through the early days or have just had a failed attempt just know it s definitely worth sticking out to get to this point Good luck everyone ,As of minutes ago I m month smoke free,0

2523,Hi everyone first post and not a very experienced redittor but I needed to ask this somewhere I started smoking at I think or I m now Several times I ve tried to quit I think the longest I ever went was a few month in my s and once for about months five years ago I ve tried cold turkey methods with guidance I ve also tried patches or vaping instead of smoking Vaping of course works its just expensive and a lot of the motivation is the cost Patches are much cheaper in my country Though its still hard to just use the patch and nothing else Anyway what really forces me back into it more than anything else is anger I know irritability is a common side effect of withdrawal The thing is even as a smoker I can be an irritable person I have actually talked to a therapist about it but I can t afford to see one right now Little stuff does frustrate me and while I have been verbally temperamental at times I have never in my life been violent I just get worked up about little stuff and can give you a nice long rant But when I don t have nicotine in my system frankly I frighten myself My thoughts are not just irritability they are violent thoughts Something in politics or entertainment will annoy me and I start having violent fantasies about the person in question I ll start to fantasize about scenarios that haven t even happened and get images in my mind that are really disturbing and violent I feel not just irritable but frankly consumed by a homicidal rage And I know the only thing that will make them go away is nicotine This can t be normal I ve tried so many times to quit and always I go right back to it because even though I hate myself as a smoker I hate myself when I m not smoking so much more I want everyone to know I can say with certainty that I am not violent in actions and never would be I ve never hurt anyone I m not a dangerous psychotic I promise you so please I m being very vulnerable by admitting that this goes on inside me I don t like that I think these things and what I m trying to figure out is if anyone elses thoughts are so extreme when they are in withdrawl and if they ever stopped if so When irritability is listed as a symptom that doesn t feel like it describes the intensity of these feelings of raw hatred I m scared to be around people I know I wouldn t hurt anyone but I might express the feeling and scare them away So I smoke And I hate it And yet I feel like I pretty much have to just give up and live with being a smoker for the rest of my life It might be less depressing than the constant failure to quit and these thoughts that plague my brain every time I try to quit ,Violent Thoughts and Withdrawal,0
2524, MONTH SPOKE FREE YOU CAN DO IT EVERYONE Don t give up, month smoke free Woohoo,0
2525,So first of all I m gonna take my small victories where I can last time I slipped I smoked cigarettes after almost days of not smoking So I m picking myself up dusting myself off and continuing to go after fewer cigarettes Obviously not smoking would have been better but I m giving myself compassion I m only human The following triggers were there for me Somebody left their cigarettes in the break room I was having a REALLY REALLY crappy Monday Like considering turning in my notice crappy I had to deal with a poopy disgusting clogged toilet at work janitorial position which Was not fixed after a solid plunge Again I m only human and a lot of people would have wanted something to take the edge off in that case The best thing I can do is be prepared to deal with such a trigger before it happens again So tonight I m meditating before bed I will meditate every night until the streak is broken Hopefully that should give me more power when next time happens so I m not letting a disgusting toilet have that much power over me ,Smoked cigarettes after almost days Review in post Warning gross,0

2527,Hey all been smoking for about years now I m having a horrible day thinking about how bad my habit is Talking with a friend about all the niche things like potential baby issues cold turkey the things I ve tried The fact of the matter is none of it puts me mentally ready to quit Wife sent me something to help the oral fixation but I ve even tried pacifiers before I m tired of spending a month on smokes I m tired of feeling the way I do And I m tired of affecting those around me But mentally I don t feel strong enough or ready enough especially when smoking or more packs a day Don t know if I m looking for advice or just ranting I know people quit and go through relapses I don t have a very addictive personality but this is just one of those things I can t shake Did you ever feel mentally unprepared What did you do to help it What really helps replace the feel of that cloth like filter between my lips besides my shirts Sorry for the back and forth Thanks for reading ,Why am I still doing this M ,0

2533,Smoking is a full time job you sign yourself up for without pay Rain snow sleet or shine your working You could call it a volunteer position but you actually pay a lot and pay constantly to participate It literally stinks and tastes terrible Smell sticks to you and effects people around you in dangerous ways It can be quite embarrassing and time consuming You find yourself working dirty allies near dumpsters and other unkept places It costs you not only your money but your health too and quite possibly your life I m in the market for a new job I quit Middle finger up Day ,Smoking is a full time job,0

2535,Day was so hard Day was easier Today is hard again My husband is attempting to quit with me He caved and bought a pack yesterday but he only smoked two out of it He wouldn t let me throw them out so I taped the pack closed and wrote over the tape overlap for accountability If either of us want one we have to break the seal I put the pack away so it s not in view but I keep thinking about the fact that it s there I really should just destroy it My brain keeps latching onto the idea of Just One It s such a lie Such a terrible lie There is no Just One There never has been One begets another begets another I ve been doing my best to keep busy Every time I get a craving I go do a chore for ten minutes It s been whether it works to stem the craving At least the house is cleaner I haven t left a single dish in the sink since my quit started lol I don t want to have to restart my timer I don t want to be a smoker I don t want to stink and cough I don t want to ruin my heart and lungs anymore I m tired of poisoning my body Even though I know I can do this it s so hard Ugh ,Day ,0

2545,As much as I despise pity partying and crying over my oh so tender feelings this time it fucking hurt I m been smoking and vaping snuffing for years quit just yesterday Now these numbers are nowhere near as impressive as coming from people with an addiction longer than my lifespan Still it sucked growing up with cigarettes and the miraculous alternative that vaping seemed to be I took a plastic bag and gathered nicotine paraphernalia that I can throw out Swelling with pride I walked up to my mum telling her think I won t need then anymore in my life She asked why I explained briefly how damaging it was When I was done going over health effects of smoking she looked at me half pitiful half disdainful and you just found out Now for the context I m taking a medical major so I m literally required to know that She s never smoked herself so probably not envy Plus I ve had some things I tried to quit in the past and she s been nothing short of perfectly supportive So why this I immediately regretted telling her and went outside to throw this bag out Needless to say I spent some time sobbing and went back straight to the bathroom to somehow conceal my red eyes She entered and I said how inappropriate this was Apparently it was meant to be a joke That s even fucking worse then I d rather be genuinely discouraged What sucks the most though is how lightly she took it having personally known a dude who died from smoking related lung cancer This dude was my age when he died And he continued smoking days before his death As minor of a thing as it was it fucked me up so hard that even the memory of these words makes me sob Thankfully my urges to smoke aren t as horrible ,Thanks for discouragement mum ,0
2546,I m posting to get this off my chest to reinforce some ideas but hopefully someone else might find this attitude useful too Honestly Fuck cigarettes They are gross they kill you They trigger problems i have with acid reflux snoring disturbed sleep and TMJ muscular pain They make me hack up shitloads of phlegm in the mornings They have caused problems in relationships most of the time a non smoker does not want to kiss a smoker regardless of what they say They make me have less energy they stain my teeth they stain my hands why the FUCK would i choose all the stuff i listed over giving up Feel like i ve been in a dream world Fuck Cigarettes i will not let you defeat me this time I ve got some NRT not vaping too much of a direct replacement for me and i ve got an app I ve told my friends and family Lets go also i guess might be posting here more often helllooooooo ,It s day ,0

2563,I ve quit cold turkey on day after smoking for years about two packs a week I really struggled through the first few weeks with irritability and cravings but got through it with the help of my partner who also quit at the same time He s been holding me accountable our main reasons for quitting was our future We want kids so we want to be as healthy as possible so we can have a long happy healthy life together But I ve just lost my care factor completely I still want his kids I still want a healthy happy life but I just can t get over the idea that we re all gunna die eventually anyway and if smoking makes me happy shouldn t I just do what makes me happy I m okay with the idea that maybe I m shaving a few years off my own life but he ll give me a guilt trip and talk me out of wanting smokes It s this whole idea that smoking has been the main toxic coping mechanism I ve used for a while while not healthy everyone has toxic coping mechanisms so my brain says it s alright TDLR There are a million reasons for me to smoke and I know I only need one reason to not smoke ie our future but I just don t care anymore ,Losing my care factor almost three months in,0

2566, years ago I stupidly started smoking again during a hard time in my life Since then I probably tried times to quit chantix patches nothing worked Recently I started meditating and doing Wim Hof breathing exercises and for me the have been absolute game changers I helped me to live in the moment and accept negative emotions and realise they are a snapshot in time and they will pass I never thought I could get here but I m days cigarette free and it feels amazing ,It finally clicked ,0
2567,So over a week here and feeling great EXCEPT for some crazy digestion To the point where I m going to the garage not to smoke but so I can be alone in my gas passing Don t feel like I m eating all that much different just a few more snacks please tell me this is normal and doesn t last long Its only been lime this for a couple days ,Stepping outside,0
2568,I m on day right now Felt really angry sad beca se my grandpa has covid and is put to hospital I had to light a cigarette and it tasted so bad I can t even believe I used to smoke I couldn t handle it and I had to throw the whole cig away after just hits I don t think I will be smoking again and I feel like throwing up Anyone else experienced this Why did it use to taste SO good when I was a smoker and now is so bad ,Cigarettes taste awful after weeks ,0
2569,It s been days now The urge to smoke is always present even tho i have a mg patch of nic on me I can t really explain how I feel bc I used to smoke packs of cigs a day for years I smoked to avoid eating when I was bored And now I feel completely lost and since I have an eating disorder quitting cig just makes me afraid of gaining weight and I feel like I m fucking losing my mind thinking abt those things I spend my time drinking water and chewing gum but I can t seem to make my hunger go away and everything s driving me nuts so yeah I m afraid I ll relapse even if I don t want to,I quit smoking last monday and I just feel like shit ,0
2570,So I ve quit smoking cold turkey about one and a half year ago I know it s a huge huge achievement and I m very proud of myself but sometimes I just miss smoking and wonder if just one would hurt Like when I m out with friends and they offer me one or just when I m in one of those nostalgic moods and it would just feel right to have a smoke Like I know that even if I just have one I ll probably won t relapse but just the thought I might scares me Also my best friend is very anti smoking because of her mom and I feel like she would be disappointed in me if I smoked even just once So in short I really want to have a smoke from time to time and I feel a bit restrained when I don t but on the other side of it all I m afraid of the disappointment and shame or even a relapse ,I am afraid of relapse,0
2571,It just feels weird It s unnatural for me to be out with other people and not smoke Taking a dump is a lot harder Can t even look at the sunset without wanting to taste tobacco again I never would ve even quit if cigarettes didn t make me look like a zombie no matter how many hours of sleep I get I will relapse any day now , days without cigarettes I feel and look a lot better but I still feel like smoking ,0
2572,Mostly posting here so I have some sort of accountability Thanks everyone ,Starting tomorrow,0
2573,Hello everyone I ve quit days ago and I can say that for now I usually don t think about smoking or miss it Honestly Yes there are some days when I think about It but rather about weird psychological tension in my chest like when you have cravings But goal of my post in the next When we have fear anxiety or something like that usually these feelings place in the middle of the chest this is the place where fears usually feels center place Every person doesn t matter smoker or not feels these feelings often in this place in the body But where we feel desire to smoke cravings In my experience It is the same place in the chest because lack of nicotine make us anxious And when we quit smoking even in months sometimes when we feel us sad or anxious we MAY think that It s cravings BUT in the real it s is just anxiety or another emotion in the chest So don t let your brain mix cravings with feelings when you feel sad or somewhat else It needs sometime to rewire our brains and find out that these feelings in the chest are not signs of the cravings Also I want to notice that very big help gives mindfulness practice especially when we have cravings It learn us to let it go One of the important skills especially when we try to free ourselves in our inner space is observe and let it go not pressure but just letting go This way we can save our energy and don t feel us overloaded You ll let it go in one day totally this feeling that you re smoker or you are ex smoker or you hate smoking or romanticize it In one day you ll just let smoking in your head disappear When you won t overthinking about It You ll know just fact that you were smoker and now you are free But don t hurry and don t make too pressure in you If you feel yourself right now sad about your decision to stop you should know you ll be better If you feel overwhelmed about your decision just do step by step You ll see you ll be better For example only one month ago I felt myself very different and harder than I feel now I don t want to describe all these changes and benefits You can check out my post where I describe benefits after month And imagine that It become more and more visible and sensible Good luck you should know you can do it if you really want I know sometimes you feel like you can t but just go forward and you ll see , days Seems I find out why psychological addiction needs time to disappear Plus some tricks ,0
2574,Here s how it went I had an accountability partner My mother This was the thing that helped me the most I quit because I was genuinely tired of smoking I hated it At day i got the worst cravings ever My mom helped me get through them After day it got easier On day I had a slip took one cigarette Day I had another slip and took another one Other than that I ve been clean I am now on day and I have no plans to go back No seriously I don t have any cravings anymore At all The desire to smoke is totally gone and I even hate the smell now I have SO MUCH MORE energy now Plus going to the gym helped me quit Conclusion quit please It will make you feel much better ,Successfully quit smoking,0

2587,I ll try to be straight foward about it because that s how sick I am of cigarettes even just talking about my struggles is driving me nuts I have smoked since I m years old and it was over the stupidiest reason ever wanting to fit in with a new group of friends the friends didn t last but damn the addiction did It has been almost years since then and I ve been talking about quiting for at least of it so I can see why I won t take myself that seriously anymore I never intended to smoke for long I just felt in an addiction that was custom made for someone as anxious and compulsive as I am This year I finally got my shit together and got to spend one month without it I d smoke very rarely one or two but still counted as quitting I didn t use any help just plain will power which was very hard but made me proud of myself Unfortunately I relapsed when one of my best friends had a very awful psychotic breakdown and I had to babysit him for months the stress simply got me and therefore for this one I forgive myself Around june I decided it was time to do it again this time with the help of bupoprione and it was actually pretty easy I don t think it was only because of the medication but also because I had the right mindset at the time THAT one reddit is always saying you need to have in order to actually quit After a month totally free I even dropped the medication because I was honestly feeling in complete control happy as never no coughs barelly any breathing issues no stinky clothes and room not even suffering while hanging with other smokers I do smoke week though which helped with these social cravings specifically Then last month I traveled with my boyfriend who likes to smoke socially but has no problem not doing it in front of me I m not sure how it happened but we decided to buy just a few cigarretes to take for camping since it was a bit of a tradition back when I used to smoke and I remember how terrible and completely scared I felt while puffing it again and of course just a few units became a few packs and soon I was back on it I know that it isn t my SO responsability to take care of me or my decisions but I felt very let down for how easy it was for him to just let me relapse while knowing how hard it was for me but I also understand him since I d be on loops saying it s ok with the medication is easy I will be one of these people who quit whenever they want and that s it Yeah right Anyways the medication didn t help this time simply because I lost that right mindset needed Up to that I did a full medical check up and it seems like although smoking clearly makes me cough and gets me throath pain I am healthier as never No ashma no allergies not a single respiratory issue to be worried about and I also don t have kids or anyone to take into consideration I know this sounds insane but the fear of immediate health issues was a great motivator and now more than never I need to do it just out of my will just for knowing it will be bad on the future just for not liking to be a smoker and this will have to do it I guess but damn that s hard I ve decided to do it again Tomorrow is the day I don t have buproprione anymore and I d take a long time to get it again so I ve bought a few nicotine tablets lots of cinnamon candy and a couple of shitty red label cigarretes as well My plan is to wake up clean my room and the disgusting ashes around and dedicate all my free time on listening Allen Carr s audiobook that s what the cigarrettes are for also if it gets really difficult to resist relapsing at least I ll do it with something that reminds me how bad it can be I ve tried all of these before and none has worked because I didn t have this mtfking mindset but I can t give up so that s how my strategy will go this time I m desperate and honestly sick of dealing with this for so long I m utterly mad and willing to use this on my favor Also I hope this time I ve learned the lesson it is never just one Thank you guys for reading I m currently the only person around me actually wanting to quit and it can get very lonely Do you guys have any other tips to help me Does anyone want to be my quitting buddy God I really hope I get it right this time Best of luck to us all ,Third time is a charm ,0

2596, How long a day feels without taking smoke breaks I get productive in a very anxious unfocused and inconsistent way just because my brain wants something to distract it for minutes every hour How annoying it is when you want to do something and you have to wait for another person to take a smoke break Or when you re watching something and have to pause it for someone else to step out Not sleeping and the intense dreams when I finally do Can t wait till I have my first Oh no I smoked dream Waking up from those always makes me more determined to stay a nonsmoker Everyone around me expecting me to behave awful because I m in the process of quitting Please let me tell you I m quitting smoking without cringing or implying you re sorry for my husband Yes my emotions are heightened no that doesn t mean I m suddenly a raging asshole Having to acknowledge how much I was using cigarettes to avoid things and letting a lot of stuff pile up Now there s no I ll deal with it after a cigarette Not this cigarette but next cigarette Well actually the cigarette after dinner Smoke smells so bad Sooooo bad How do I always forget how bad it smells All of my clothes smell so gross I want to take showers and spend two hours brushing my teeth What are some of yours ,Things I forgot about quitting,0

2611,Checking in here at the end of the last cigarette of my life I had quit vaping which I had picked up to stop smoking at new years of months later during a time where I decided to not drink for a while either I had thought I was strong enough feeling good enough in control enough to have a cigarette while visiting a friend This obviously meant I was OK to smoke while I wasn t drinking and hanging out with smokers This then meant I was OK to smoke when I was drinking and hanging out with smokers This then meant I was OK to have a cigarette when drinking and hanging out with non smokers This then meant I was OK to smoke in the day just by myself and here I am all over again The slope is indeed very slippery and rationalised all the way through I end up hating myself for this regression and realisation that I can t control it without a change Here I am for day again along with not drinking for a month to get past the initial phase I ll be visiting here whenever I feel tempted and am looking forward to that feeling when I had indeed quit for a while where smoking wasn t on my mind whatsoever And more importantly the old adage is true one is too many a thousand isn t enough ,Don t be me I had quit successfully for months then picked up just one which led to months of smoking again ,0

2625,Apologies in advance this is super rambly because I m fighting a craving and I need to keep my brain distracted I quit smoking in Dec Cold turkey full stop I had a week long relapse in Jul stemming from the desire to just have one cigarette with a beer on the patio and stopped it from going any further I felt so strong and almost kind of smug I kicked its ass and walked away My husband quit in Sep on our wedding day We went on honeymoon and actually got to enjoy ourselves instead of stopping every hour to refill with nicotine In Dec my dad was diagnosed with cancer I almost relapsed In Apr my brother died suddenly I started smoking at the viewing Three months later my husband started smoking again too Since then I ve had four attempted quits Each lasted between days and weeks and then the stress became unbearable Two nights ago I went out for my last cig of the night and it tasted like I was smoking straight ammonia Like just insanely gross and acrid I have no idea why I d smoked the whole rest of the pack without issue Something about that last one just really tasted disgusting And I put it out immediately Yesterday I couldn t bring myself to want to smoke the memory of that taste still fresh in my mind Around pm I got a little antsy for one but I realized I was almost at hours and it seemed dumb to give up that progress for something I don t even actually need Today is hard My husband got up and got his coffee and went outside to smoke and my addiction monster keeps telling me I could just have one Isn t it nice to sit in the sunshine Isn t the weather particularly nice out Isn t this the kind of day you wait all year for balanced between summer warmth and fall chill Yes But none of it is made better by a cigarette And I know that I know it to my very core that it s a beautiful lie The cigarette will always be the least enjoyable part of what it tells me it enhances In reality it enhances nothing It s a useless smelly expensive anchor And I hate that I want it right now hours have elapsed I know I m halfway through the worst of it and I m trying to hold onto that I m just so frustrated with all of it I m mad at myself more than anything for being back here again And I know the way to make it up to myself is to succeed And I know I ve found success before But right now it s hard not to be down on myself ,Back on the wagon and trying to stay on,0
2626,Just found out I m pregnant I ve been planning a quit strategy for a few months in preparation to this stage with strong motivation that I wouldn t go through a second pregnancy smoking throughout again The guilt is debilitating but I won t go into that right now I will just say I ve even attended psychologist sessions to find if I could find some underlying reason to why cigarettes are so deeply wired into my ability to function I ve attempted quit many times now Even after even a few hours I get crazy Like I start frothing with rage act like I m possessed have tantrums wail crying just severe withdrawals I know withdrawals are hard but I don t think the way I have them are far from normal So I found out I m pregnant went slow with the pack I had left got all my gum nibbles etc ready Wrote a journal entry telling cigs to F off and began my quit at pm yesterday I already had an episode around pm after dinner had to hide myself in the bedroom closet but my yr old saw bits of me sobbing and it infuriated me further Woke up at am and am again I had a massive tantrum acting like I was possessed screaming into my pillow and at am I told my husband this wasn t worth it and had a smoke I ve read Allen Carr know everything about nicotine addiction power of the mind Like I ve done my research I m willing to go through the temporary pain but the withdrawals When they re there I lose my self completely Does anyone have similar experiences and how did you manage it I m desperate and feel so pathetic ,Doomed to smoke forever ,0
2627,So I was smoking cigarettes a day for years days ago I decided to quit smoking and to my surprise I was extremely easy There was no effort or struggle involved simply one day I woke up and didn t smoke I have had zero withdrawal effects zero cravings and only positives better taste smell and skin I have zero desire to ever smoke another cigarette I was even offered one while I was on a night out and drunk Lots of people find quitting smoking to be very difficult What could be the reason its really easy for me ,Quitting smoking has been extremely easy What does this say about me ,0

2629,I used to have no problem starting and quitting smoking Like I could smoke a full year then quit cold turkey I usually smoked for fun not to deal with anything though back then A lot happened last year and this year so I picked up smoking again to deal with shit A month later I switched to vaping to be healthier Then I quit that months later for a week and then I bought cigarettes again I am doing good mentally again but seems like I still crave cigarettes I quit cigs again since recently but I feel myself wanting something to DO whenever I feel a craving I feel like I can quit again if I hold on long enough to let go of that craving like I did in the past I noticed I mostly like to smoke as a way to destress and it simply became a habit So if I just replace it with a healthier habit I feel like I can easily quit smoking So what things can I do when I feel that urge I was thinking about regular gum chewing Any other ideas of small easy things I can do ,Small things you can do as a distraction from smoking ,0

2664, I had a strong reason I guess the same one anyone who is a chronic smoker has except that I was straight up told by a doctor that my lungs look like a mid s smokers lungs in the x ray pics I was late twenties That was a wake up punch I wasn t in the hospital related to respiratory issues just pre operation testing An old man I know quit too after I guess years of smoking Him quitting didn t mean much to me but the way he did it He said You can t think of stopping smoking as NEVER smoking again you can only think of it as you are not smoking NOW That is the key attitude in stopping smoking That was brilliant It is infinitely less burden less draining less of a mental weight to think of it as just not smoking this moment Just this moment not today this hour or anything Just NOW The never smoking again path attitude is such a pain its like carrying a chain with you at all times it is unsustainable Imagine forbidding yourself from doing anything ever again its a horrible feeling Its also depressing as shit Imagine when you are badly tempted one of those moments where everything seems meaningless if you just don t light just one sweet cigarette and puff away all of the turmoil In those moments if you go by Never mindset you say to yourself No no no no and fight your urges Excruciatingly Such a waste of energy Such anguish Beating yourself up by yourself Impossible And when you exhaust yourself you of course succumb Now imagine the opposite You get in that hole of despair and you tell yourself okay in five minutes I ll have one What happens is that your body calms because all of the craving parts of you have a resolution They will get what they want in just a few minutes No fight with yourself no mental push pull And urges last less than five minutes which is convenient and also lose power over time and ultimately go away When I stopped I carried a pack of smokes with me for couple of months just so whenever I had a desire to smoke I could say to myself okay in five minutes I will light up one No fear cigarettes are in my pocket and only minutes away from my mouth and my lungs And in five minutes I didn t want one anymore actually I wouldn t even think of it anymore Please try it It sounds way too simple but it effing works Last is a little mental rewrite Cigarettes are not calming sedating or in any way helping you relax They are relaxing your physical addiction to cigarettes You didn t need them before you started doing them You smoke get addicted crave them craving makes you uneasy you smoke them you relax the craving some time passes you crave again They are not friends amp x B That is all folks this worked for me I tried never again attitude many times and trust me this one worked ,One year smoking free how I did it,0

2680,Hello beautiful people I M have been a smoker for years until an hour ago I smoked between packets a day I have trying to quit for quite some time now and have been failing miserably Smoking something that I hate for so long and the constant failures have given me depression and tanked my self confidence It s not that I enjoy smoking in fact with every passing day I hate it more This depression has impacted other areas of my life my career is going down hill because I can t focus and have zero motivation I have been out of touch with my friends I am trying to spend less and less time with girlfriend I have stopped working out and I don t know if it really is because of failing to quit smoking but that s the only plausible culprit in my mind I am making one last attempt at quitting smoking if I fail I will make peace with this addiction and accept what it entails But I have promised myself I won t go down without a fight I have always failed not because of crazy compulsion but because I convince myself that one more won t hurt Now I am thinking if cigarette is really as bad as I make it out to be then I shouldn t even try one more If you are going though something similar and have gone through this and emerged on a top I would love to hear what you have to say ,Quit smoking today,0
2681,Rationally I know that smoking is just a stupid waste of money and health However I started when I was just due to peer pressure and deep inside of me the belief that having a cigarette in my mouth makes me look better cooler is still very strong Now I m in my mid s and I ve been a smoker for half of my life I don t even remember how it feels not to be one I ve always struggled with my self image and with agoraphobia and smoking was my coping mechanism and my way to elevate myself to the standard of people around me In my culture Italian it is a very social thing and the feeling that it s cool transgressive is still moderately strong among young people Now I ve moved to a country where smoking is way more frowned upon but I still can t get rid of this feeling that I will look like a loser if I don t start rolling up a cigarette every time I leave a building or have one in my hand as I walk to my workplace ,How do I convince myself that smoking doesn t make me a better person ,0
2682,Hey everybody I am relatively new to this forum I think this is a great community and i m not entirely sure where to ask this question I started vaping relatively a year ago at a very young age unfortunately I occasionally get worried about my health which is ironic because of my tendency to smoke When I first started I used a juul and went through roughly pods I took a year long break but got back into it when I started college This time around I started using disposables airflows bidi sticks etc I probably went through about disposables but I hope I got through my last one As I said I was wondering if anyone knows if I stay clean will I have to worry about bad health problems like cancer or something I never smoked actual cigarettes just those pods and roughly disposables over a time period of ish years I really do want to stay clean as smoking in general makes my stomach hurt and id rather live a long life with my girlfriend Any type of insight is appreciated ,Stopped smoking after a years of on and off Potential health problems ,0

2684,I was a pack and a day cigarette smoker for one year and since switching to vaping years ago it s been my crutch in all aspects of life I vape CONSTANTLY I go through slightly more than one disposable every day and sometimes I m wide awake until am just sucking on my vape Being alone vaping in bed in the morning is undoubtedly the highlight of my day I often drink in excess just to get a stronger hit on the vape I could care less about the potential health effects or honestly the enormous cost it s vaping toll on my mental health that s made me want to quit for the past year or so I have struggled with treatment resistant depression generalized anxiety and OCD for most of my life In the short term hitting my vape alleviates symptoms but the rush and relaxation of it becomes the center of my world And of course being without nicotine for as short a time as minutes causes all my mental health issues to begin to rear their heads I ve put off actually quitting by reasoning that I should finally work out my other issues first lest they get very intense during withdrawal However the vaping is so intermingled with my mental health woes that I think they re unsolvable without taking away the nicotine addiction first Does anyone have similar experiences with mental health struggles and nicotine addiction Any advice on how I should approach quitting It s much appreciated ,Quitting vaping that s commingled with OCD depression and anxiety,0

2696, Hello I desperately need your opinions on something I have been struggling with I am a non smoker and my girlfriend is a smoker She has been smoking cigarettes a day for about years After months of dating we have decided to move forward with our relationship and introduce each other to family as her family is visiting town in November I told her I was not okay with her being a smoker when we spoke about this and she immediately agreed she wanted to quit For her first attempt we did a sober July on which she quit cigarettes cold turkey and we both quit drinking for the entire month It was tough for her especially the first week or so I did notice she seemed a bit less energetic and a bit more lethargic I tried my best to fill in our free time with healthy activities like hiking and going for walks and remained supportive and upbeat She fell off the wagon in September during a particularly tough month at work and has been smoking ever since She called her doctor and got prescribed Chantix but there is currently a Chantix recall meaning that is not an option right now She talks about wanting to quit before November when her family comes but I am struggling to see how Without the Chantix I am nervous about her falling off the boat as the first few weeks of nicotine withdrawal are insanely tough Additionally it seems like her triggers are coffee drinking and stress She is not a heavy drinker so we both have decided to avoid bars as much as possible With that being said coffee goes hand in hand with cigarettes and she once spoke about getting her caffeine intake in another fashion However she is talking about buying a new coffee maker which is a bit confusing to me I m nervous as I don t see her quitting while she continues to drink coffee I have suggested exercise as a replacement but she does not seem too eager to take that on right now I don t feel comfortable moving forward with the relationship if she continues to smoke We have talked about this issue and she knows the cigarettes need to go but I am struggling to see how when Chantix is not available there is a new coffee maker in the house and exercise is not a priority I m not trying to tell her what to do but I do not feel comfortable getting serious with someone who smokes regularly Should I have another conversation about this Should I trust her to quit and just be supportive What would help us both be on the same page here I am unfamiliar with nicotine addiction so any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated Thank you all amp x B TLDR My girlfriend agreed to quit smoking quit then resumed smoking She wants to quit but is struggling I am not comfortable moving forward with the relationship if she continues to smoke What can I do to help her ,How Can I Help my SO Quit Smoking ,0

2709,Hi guys Im smoke free for week now and its surprisingly easy I was a smoker for years I used patches for the first days and then nothing I dont even think of cigarettes at all tbh but i have one or two cravings per day but not that intense The main reason i stopped smoking now i planned stopping for a while i reall hated it that ive been to spain for two weeks now amd smoking is forbidden everywhere so if i wanted to smoke i had to stand up walk away and smoke at the street instead of the bar or restaurant and i found that very disturbing and socially stigmatized I couldnt even smoke at the airport on my way back although i had to get there hours before take off so that was a test itself Since then i run every day today i ran K and my lungs are amazing now its more clear already so if you plan to give up smokeing do it ,My one week journey so far,0
2710,Exactly one year ago I posted here that I was quitting smoking I did really well for about months felt amazing and was really proud of myself Then as the same old story goes I was having a drink with a friend who was smoking and I thought sure Ill have one Well here I am a year later starting over again Something about the fall equinox makes me feel change I am embarrassed to tell friends and family because a they smoke or b they think I can t won t do it If I did tell them I think they would be thinking ok here we go again As a reference my oldest son is about the same age I was when I started smoking I cringe to admit it was over years ago It is something I have always done whether in joy or sorrow Sure I have quit for long periods of time but seem to always find my way back I feel compelled to say some days a barely smoke at all or Drinking is a big trigger that requires much smoking So community I ask you can anyone out there relate and have any great stories and advise for someone who feels embarrassed to say hey I quit smoking again,Hey it is me again,0

2727,Hi guys Please excuse any formatting issues while I am not new to lurking here I am to posting So ten years of smoking Started off in college while drinking always bumming smokes and never buying any super annoying to all the smokers out there yes After college bigger jobs bigger relationships bigger problems more smoking I have had the opportunity to work all over the world with my career and also the honour of paying the wildly different waccy tabbacy prices along the way Didn t matter if it was in California years ago or in Adelaide not so long ago I always paid Im now in Canada and dutifully shell out at least times a week before to the nice lady at the Chevron down the street Now let talk about the lighters THE LIGHTERS Im sure Ive spent on shitty bic lighters of all colours in my in lifetime Half of which my washing machine ate and the other half of which can no longer be accounted for Gone forever RIP SO days hours and minutes without a shitty cig at this point Now to be fair I have taken to a vape like a baby does a soother but its a step for me Good luck out there guys and gals , years and and god knows how many lighters gone ,0
2728,Okay I slipped and smoked two cigarettes between today and August th but this is the best I ve done in my entire life I F smoked for years about a pack a day for half of it and then I got down to half a pack but I was completely consumed in this addiction I still have my days where one wouldn t hurt and I got some devastating news about my wedding next year where I almost slipped and bought a pack but I held on and I m typing this post without a cigarette in between my fingers This shit is hard but it s worth it This is your sign to keep on truckin ,I made it an entire year without cigarettes,0
2729,I ve been taking nicotine in various forms for the past years First years cigarettes th th year vape with occasional cigs past year glo Averaging at around cigs per day I m male and have an addictive personality It s been over days and it goes paradoxically fine No urges no cravings no nothing Granted I was eating a lot this weekend was figuratively raping my fridge all the day long like there is no tomorrow Also I feel that my temper has been shortened a lot every single thing around triggers some primal rage in me and I believe I have some problems concentrating while doing some work But with all of that I feel a lot of energy confidence motivation and sometimes pure euphoria that outweighs the negatives And the most important thing is that deep inside I honestly don t feel the need for the cig I mean I do realize that nicotine will lift some of those withdrawal symptoms but somehow I don t even feel the need to rationalize that smoking a cig will be only temporal solution I genuinely don t feel the need for the nicotine What s interesting I ve already tried quitting In contrast to the story above I went cold turkey for half a year about years ago First two weeks were pure hell every night getting myself to sleep was a challenge I was not just sweating I was melting in my bed with my hands shaking and for every damn second my mind was occupied with the one and only thought I cannot do this any longer I have to find some cigs For some reason second attempt is going much smoother Maybe that s because I mostly switched from cigs to vape glo but I felt no discomfort upon switching had no withdrawals So at that time I assumed vape glo won t help me with quitting as the nicotine intake remained the same I also had several trips on acid in which I had a thought that s it s time to stop smoking Well not just a thought a complete serious internal conversation how pretentious wouldn t that sound There are some cases you can find in the internet where LSD made a huge impact in battling addiction mostly alcohol Maybe it worked for me either Anyway I m feeling uplifted so I wanted to share this one with you Thanks for reading ,Turned out quitting is insanely easy,0

2736,I recently picked up cigarettes again due to a stressful situation I didn t think I was going to be able to cope with I ve tried vaping and some days I can get by with just vaping but others I ll go out and buy cigarettes I really hate vaping too and don t want to do that either The thing is I m so mad at myself I quit this habit several years ago and it was extremely difficult I want to stop but I just end up going out and buying another pack No one knows I ve started and I want to stop before anyone finds out The general shitty feeling I have about starting smoking again almost makes me want to smoke more I m stressed about starting smoking so I smoke to attempt to relieve that stress It never works I wish I could stop I m so angry at myself I have mental health issues and that makes it even more difficult Beating myself up over this is not helping If I knew I could quit whenever I wanted I d feel better The problem is I don t know if I will be able to TL DR Started smoking again and I hate myself for it ,Started smoking again how can I not hate myself,0
2737,Anyone have experience with hypnotherapy here Does it work I can t stop smoking Part of it is I m a suicidal nihilist and I want to die The other part is the obvious addiction I also genuinely enjoy it I can substitute weed for tobacco but then I d just be stoned ALL the time I m thinking hypnosis might be the way to go because nicotine seems to be the one thing I have no self control over this is coming from someone who used to do opiates alcohol benzos and cocaine on a daily basis I don t do any of those anymore just marijuana and occasionally alcohol but I am just having the hardest time kicking nicotine I have even quit in the past but that s mostly because I had things to look forward to when I wake up and life in general That is not the case anymore My life fucking sucks I hate my job My social circle sucks My friends are all assholes and I don t really want to spend time with them Also I just got diagnosed with scoliosis and my car was stolen Everything around every corner is fucking shit so why bother quitting smoking Before you start saying some high horse shit I m already going to therapy and on medication which is also used to quit smoking apparently but hasn t helped I feel like Peter in office space I just need to be fucking hypnotized into quitting smoking and pretending my life isn t complete dogshit ,Hypnosis ,0

2751,So I started vaping no nicotine vape juice when I was Then high school started and it seemed like everyone had mg nicotine vape juice so I decided to do the same Then I was I hit my first juul after vaping only mg and godDAMN I felt brain cells die I was so dizzy I kind of fell in love with the buzz after that Then I had a day where my dad tackled me so I went from mg to mg I remember being so stomach sick but the buzz really took the edge of Then hit I d be smoking cigarettes my friend showed me a way to take the filter out and smoke with only half the filter I now just turned and I m really looking back thinking I hurt my brain and caused damaged I quit all together for days and I remember how much better I felt and looked Color was actually appearing in my cheeks Now that I m I told myself I m never buying a pack I have surgery coming up and my plan is to quit right after surgery Any tips Need to be motivated and strengthened ,I need help quitting,0
2752,So hear me out when I started my quit one week ago I d already been trying to quit for a week Around the same time I also went back to eating whole food plant based Without getting on a soap box I eat plants with as little processing as possible high starch high fiber low fat and low salt no refined oils or sugars I think this has REALLY helped me a quit and here s why This way of eating gets you hydrated eating meat and meat by products will dehydrate you not to mention all the salt Water helps flush out residual nicotine and supports ALL those bodily systems smoking has punished all these years plus staying hydrated just makes you feel better overall The standard American diet is full of oils sodium and sugar that yes will dehydrate you but also push your dopamine receptors like they were buttons on a game controller which will ignite your cigarette cravings Eating this way doesn t give you that same sensation and for me seemed to help abate the intensity of the post meal craving Side note devious nicotine addiction knows that our bodies digestive absorption rates sky rocket post meal allowing more of the cigarette to be absorbed quicker supposedly one after meal cigarette is worse than smoking cigarettes Finally it ll help the healing process while giving you confidence Eating this way gives your body a ton of nutrient dense foods rather than calorie dense foods so your body gets what it needs helping it heal And honestly it d be really hard to gain weight while eating this way In fact my first week I lost five pounds just eating potatoes rice veggies fruit and beans That really gave me a nice confidence boost during the times I was feeling weak or just down on myself Even if you don t change your whole diet I would bet just eating more veggies and fruits and less meat and fats would really help you deal with the first few weeks of stopping I hope this helps Good luck and stick to the stop ,Maybe a Helpful Trick Eat More Vegetables,0

2756,I started smoking freshman year with the juul about years ago ever since ive been running through my own vapes and it has been an everyday thing i would say the myle mini disposable vapes would last me about days per vape not the pack recently about a month ago i moved to europe and its impossible to find an adequate vape to calm my smoking habits In the states i promised i would never smoke cigarettes but i fucked up and did it to look cool and to catch a buzz ive been maybe going thru a pack every days including sharing and such this past weeks i have been coughing like crazy w mucus and i know its a smokers cough im going yo stop completly tommorow i feel the most motivated to quit than ever but I need to know if this cough will go away Tonight my through started feeling pinched im not sure if thats because i smoked cigs just today or because i had some cornbread and something feels lodged in my throat Im coughing now but it seems there is no mucus coming out just a pinching feeling when i swallow or turn my head a certain way has anyone been in my situation or is in my situation right now I feel a little scared as if I fucked up big time smoking cigs for a month while previously smoking weed and vaping for the past for years what should I do about this cough Does anyone have it figured out ,Need information,0
2757,So I m a yo male from Scandinavia I ve been snusing and smoking for years For those of you who don t know what snus is It s like american dip only way stronger nicotine levels And I ve tried quitting times this year and I finally snapped this weekend I couldn t take it anymore I ve made it months free using a combination of chantix and nicotine free snus or using a piece of ginger under my lips to get the burning sensation I also used heavy painkillers the first week to up my dopamine levels which helped a lot with cravings although I am not endorsing recreational drug use I have a pescription for back pain Also quitting at a time when I had low stress levels in my life helped a lot If you want to know made me cave in then continue reading It might help some of you fellow quitters to get some perspective maybe So here s the thing I recently moved to a new place to study On a remote island in the middle of nowhere I don t know anyone here there is basicaly no one in my age group at the school so I don t socialize much There s nothing to do besides the usual A life a lot of dead air waiting for the bus and other boredoms I ve also been in quarantine for days because I got Covid and to make the isolation even worse I m not even allowed a pet where I live So hello Marlboro my old friend I ve come to talk to you again The boredom and isolation isn t the only thing that triggered me It s also the fact that the irritability that comes from withdrawal never seems to go away for me and the only thing that calms my anger is nicotine So I just went and bought a six pack and a pack of cigarettes this Friday because I snapped at a student and a teacher and I figured it can t be like this If this is how it s supposed to be then what s the point of quitting at all snapping at people and and having a burning rage that lasts for months nah I m on my second pack now I don t feel very addicted however they do calm me down Does the anger ever go away , Months Free from cigarettes however ,0
2758,Really this time I ve decided to post here to give myself some accountability sorry if this is not allowed I m sick of this dirty habit always feeling out of breath and wasting my money The two will be gone in the morning and I ll report back in and hours to keep myself motivated On a side note has anyone had any success with Nicotine gum or similar replacements or is cold turkey always better , cigarettes left and then I m done,0
2759,I finally passed the hour mark and I m thrilled I m also super proud of myself because it seems like my mentality must have changed internally somehow I m also constantly around smokers for reasons I can t control But I m still holding my ground My body smells disgusting though It s like I can smell the detox coming out of my skin All day today I ve only sucked on nicotine lozenges and I m making sure to use them as sparingly as possible Internally I m a bit of a mess I keep thinking about painful life experiences some recent and some from years ago But overall it s good to have some sort of feelings again because I was always just numbing myself out by puffing away instead of dealing with anything I m lucky that I m in a situation where I can afford to just focus on quitting and not focus on anything else I m going for insanely long walks because I just feel restless Exploring the area Mostly keeping to myself I m also a lot more down with the never take another puff mentality now Which is great That way I ll be less likely to fall for those sneaky thoughts Wishing everyone luck on their quits , day hours minutes and seconds I m a hot mess ,0
2760,I could only find one post about this I personally can t do the whole nicotine gum or vape thing Nicotine gum makes me ill and vaping just feels weird and like another potential addiction My plan is to just taper and then quit But I found this product called the Rien pipe that is supposed to filter out nicotine Curious to know if anyone has used it ,Rien Pipe ,0

2763,Just hit day of no cigarettes Smoked a pack a day for a year and a half Last three weeks have been up and down While I don t mind sitting by myself on the couch all my hobbies seem to be so much less fun with out that thirty minute expectation of about to smoke another cig Also social interactions have become a huge burden as my buddies birthday was this weekend but just did not have the energy or desire to go and talk to people Definitely have felt a separation from my best friends and girlfriend but know it s my nicotine withdrawn poisoned mind Without this subreddit my journey would be impossible This page showed me how many people have gone through this same thing and the advice has been invaluable Thanks so much everyone here s so hoping I won t have to reset my timer ,Almost through Week ,0
2764,I don t miss it and don t even remember I used to smoke unless it comes up somehow My best advice is to keep trying and don t give up no matter how many times you fail at quitting I switched from buying packs to rolling my own sometime late last year and I threw away my rolling supplies upwards of times before I quit for good and I don t regret it I might have wasted a lot of money re buying the rolling supplies when I caved but it worked as extra incentive to kick the habit because after the rd time it s impossible to ignore how absurd this addiction yo yo is Be kind to yourself even when you mess up Note all the little signs of progress including the way you re thinking about smoking and quitting A lot of the time the way you re mentally framing smoking and quitting is more important The biggest thing for me was just accepting I was going to be more miserable for a while And that s hard to accept when life is a struggle already But just going in knowing that quitting is going to lead to moodiness headaches stress brain fog and tiredness helped me to handle all those things Initially I was so scared of the effects of quitting that I didn t want to try it But once I just embraced the idea like yeah I am just going to be less than peak for a couple weeks things got a lot better It meant my expectations for myself in any given situation needed to be different while I was quitting I couldn t expect myself to be at during the withdrawl period so I didn t I went to work and gave it everything I had considering my brain felt like it was buried under layers of cotton I napped a lot because sleeping was just better than being awake I went for a lot of walks because aerobic exercise helped with the stress and the headaches When I ate fast food as a coping mechanism I didn t beat myself up over it just took time to notice how upset it made my stomach and acknowledged it really only added to my list of general ills Overall I just tried to be really kind to my body That was hard for me as obviously smoking is quite unkind to the body and I had to confront and acknowledge just how much I d been physically harming myself with smoking as well as realize that for various reasons I personally struggle with being kind to myself So that was something I needed to learn and a mental muscle I needed to exercise Just a normal level of decency to ones own flesh what does that look like What do I want that to look like How does that feel in my body I treated quitting as a physiological and psychological process with actionable steps and obtainable goals I studied the physical effects of nicotine withdrawal and mentally prepared for the effects and their timelines I used an app that tracked what my blood and lungs and heart were experiencing without cigarettes quittracker but there s tons of others Knowing the science facts about what was happening to me physiologically helped reassure me that no matter what I was experiencing in my head this was normal as a reaction to quitting and I needed to keep it in perspective that it wasn t a permanent change to my experience of existing I didn t titrate down or use assistance drugs or slowly taper my use I just quit cold turkey over and over again until it stuck and in the meantime I tried to work on habits of kindness towards myself both in my thinking and in my behavior As I exercised my self kindness compassion muscles I was more readily able to face the symptoms of withdrawl and grind through the weeks of symptoms and weeks of habit building necessary to enforce a lasting change So to anyone else working to quit good luck and be kind to yourself It s hard and you deserve compassion no matter what part of the journey you re at Remember that growth and progress are not linear but cyclical and you ve gained something new from each cycle you ve gone through ,Haven t smoked in eight months now,0
2765,The last couple of days not only have the cravings been intense but I am so grumpy and easily irritable I m sad and feeling negative thoughts about myself my body who I am Maybe it s not entirely related to quitting cigs but it feels like the emotions thought cycles and especially the irritability are definitely much worse Note I also quit coffee for the time being while I quit cigs Are these withdrawal symptoms Will they ease soon ,Day no cigarettes I am very irritable anxious and grumpy I don t feel like myself How long will this last ,0

2767,I started smoking at the age of At first to catch a buzz with friends Within a year I was at nearly a pack a day Eventually I got to a little over a pack a day and continued that way through my wife giving birth to kids and for the next years of my life Eventually reached the point where I smoked more years of my life than not In I tried quitting using Chantix Luckily it was covered under my insurance It seemed to do a decent enough job but gave me the weirdest dreams and some awful nightmares I never fully quit while taking Chantix and stopped taking it which lead me to smoking full force again At this point it was more troublesome I didn t smoke in the car with my kids so a car ride was something like this Smoke just before getting the the car If the trip was under an hour I would smoke as soon as we got to where we were going If it was longer i would take a smoke break about every hour This left me smelling of smoke sometimes and making my wife car sick from the smell and the motion of driving It got to the point where I was concerned about cancer and what my future would be like and wondering if my kids would pick up the habit I tried to quit a couple more times without telling anyone so that if I failed only I would know My buddy quit and went to vaping He tried to get me to vape and that lasted maybe a couple months but I still smoked actual cigarettes It didn t help me One day in June of I had just left Bo Jangles for lunch As any smoker knows you have to have a smoke right after eating As soon as I got in my truck I fired up the after lunch cigarette I immediately got a headache and as I was sitting there I could see the nicotine stains across my windshield from the glare of the sun I asked myself Why am I still doing this I took my cigarette my pack my lighter and tossed them all in the trash can I drove home tossed my remaining carton in the trash told my wife I was done smoking I went on FaceBook and announced that I was quitting That way I would be held accountable The next months were rough I kept trying to convince myself to just get one last pack Smoke one last cigarette I started slicing carrots and celery and putting them in baggies to much on when the impulse to smoke came on People often don t think about the hand to mouth motion being habitual and a hard thing to drop So people often lead to excessive snacking as a coping mechanism I made smoking my enemy this time Looked at is as an entity that was trying to kill me I hated it After about a year the smell would turn my stomach I could smell the person in front of me at a stop light if they were smoking Going into stores where an employee had just gotten back from a smoke break That smell It was nauseating For nearly years I kept having dreams that I smoked or bought a pack and fired one up I would wake up angry thinking it really happened then sigh in relief that it was just a dream It has now been years I have officially been a non smoker longer than a smoker again I have been alive for years and smoked only of them It was oddly depressing to know that for about years I was a smoker longer than I was not Now that has been reversed My buddy who quit smoking by vaping is still vaping After all these years Vaping as much as he did years ago I am proud to say I haven t cracked Not even once Not even a puff since I quit on June th It s possible I m not a man of great feats I have no super powers I am as average as they come If I can do it I think you can do it It s hard It takes determination It is well worth it in the long run I m saving over a day which I ve put toward a hobby I m not passing down a terrible life altering habit to my kids My wife likes kissing me again she never smoked I don t smell like an ashtray anymore My fingertips aren t yellow with nicotine stains anymore If you re reading this you re in the right place trying to do the right thing You got this I believe in you ,I quit smoking years ago successfully and this is what happened ,0

2769,Been a smoker for few years I ve picked up the habit of smoking alone in the recent months since I ve kind of withdrawn from the socializing in order to quit from other substances I went for a marriage for a couple of days this weekend outside town It gave me a space to dwell on this As I went past my daily limit that I had set for myself I understood that this is a killer substance to hold onto Keeping the story until here As I m writing this after smoking the last bud in my packet I ve decided to take a break from this at least until Christmas I live in India and it is not at all easy for a chap like me to sober up for even three months It s easily available around and every medium glorifies the use of ciggerates here My social circle is prone to all kind of substances and hence there is no judgement even if I smoke Wish me luck ,Thinking of taking a break from ciggerates ,0

2772,Hi all Really seeking some advice here I ve been a heavy tobacco smoker for roughly six years I m now and only in the past weeks have I been exclusively on the vape strength mg chain vaping all day After deciding to give that one up a few days ago the symptoms have been nothing short of debilitating Aside from the obvious discomfort the main point of contention is these crazy mood swings I ve never experienced before and insomnia I honestly hadn t cried in close to years until yesterday Full on tears blubbering runny nose I cannot for the life of me sleep I am utterly restless and feel as though I m always on the verge of tears I m crazy emotional right now and want to know when or if the mist should begin to clear Really hoping that this isn t going to be my default state of mind from now on because if it is and smoking was just suppressing these emotions I would rather go back on them to be honest I need a reason to trudge on and I m struggling to find one Thanks , days cold turkey Are these symptoms normal ,0

2774,I ve stopped smoking cigarettes pot and even cutting myself down to beer a week I feel mentally the clearest I ve felt since I was But to be honest my lungs have been having on and off chest discomfort I think it s getting better but I m just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience P S I wish you all luck with your addiction and know it gets easier with time ,Well I m month and days cigarette free ,0
2775,I was clean from smoking and vaping for over a year and a half then had a job for work in Mexico and chain smoked while drinking with coworkers Back to a half pack a day now and the wife is losing her shit about it Feeling ashamed and trying to dig my way back outta this hole but everything just sucks She s not making things any easier talking divorce and just pushing a lot of anger at me if any of you guys are thinking just one is okay don t do it This fucking sucks ,Fell off the wagon ,0
2776,Some background history me and my wife both smokers discovered almost h ago that she is pregnant We decided to quit from that time until now she didn t smoked but I couldn t I m y o smoke since I had and a at least pack per day since my I want to be strong for her But in this hours I had to smoke cigarettes I m worried if I could do it Any advice would be great ,I just discovered that I will became father I need to stop smoking but don t know even how to start it ,0
2777,Hey guys I got nobody to share this with so I announce it to you guys here Starting from the th this month I go smokefree Why at the th you ask It is the start of my week holiday I only smoke when I am not at home At home I have other things to do then smoking and I am also never in a stress situation so I thought this will be the best period to start to not smoke Once I go back to work it will be hard to not smoke anymore but I am full of positivity that I can manage that challrnge as well Wish me luck guys ,Starting th September,0
2778,Brain fog walking around aimlessly keep forgetting what I m doing I quit all my other vices FIRST this time because usually me needing a substitute for smoking would cause all kinds of bad behaviour or replacements So this time I m quitting and just coping through the withdrawal Now I can t sleep though I have a ton of energy acid reflux I m feeling pain everywhere in my body The cigarette withdrawal has never been this bad before maybe because I d usually drink while quitting IDK I also feel emotional but also alive I feel all sweaty and shaky on the outside and my skin is oily but I also feel clean and energized which seems paradoxical because I also feel exhausted Rollercoaster I just hope this levels out sooner rather than later This time I m also taking tons of vitamins and supplements as well as an acid reducer because I always get GERD when I m quitting and I m taking probiotics too because quitting normally gives me the runs for some reason I am sucking on nicotine lozenges as well but in moderation and I have to keep spitting them out anyway because they start to make me feel sick after about minutes of sucking on them Just sharing I guess not really looking for advice or anything I just don t want to feel alone with this , hours in and it s intense ,0

2786,Found my note from one day before I quit months ago after smoking a pack a day for years and while having a tough time mentally Is the lowest point not the best time to quit When on top you don t want to ruin it But when low it s already so bad and you already have anxiety and panic attacks it can hardly get worse It s a perfect time to fall apart completely and start building yourself up from scratch You are strong you CAN do it And yes it did get worse but I was so tired of all the shit I just went by hoping that after I get the nicotine out of the system shit will get better And it slowly is ,Quit when on lowest point not highest,0

2789,My boyfriend is trying to quit smoking and it has been about a week since he quit We are currently in a long distance relationship and he is on the other side of the world so time differences are already a strain However with him having quit smoking all he wants to do is sleep or play video games because that s the only way he knows how to deal with his cravings He sleeps for about hours a day and is constantly taking sleeping pills because he would rather be asleep than awake I m trying not to be selfish and I know that he is having a rough time but I am also having a rough time because I feel like there is a lack of attention to the relationship and spending time together because he is focusing so hard on trying to keep his cravings at bay I have never smoked so I don t really understand what it feels like to quit I m really proud of him for trying and I want to see him be successful Does anyone have any tips for how to deal with this situation Also how can I be more supportive of him ,Boyfriend is trying to quit smoking how do I deal ,0

2792,So around this time last Saturday I extinguished the last cigarette I will ever smoke One thing that helped me was to name the various feelings discomforts and urges because what can be named can be understood It helped to classify the different experiences into three camps withdraws cravings suggestions So when I d feel physical pressure in my head after a meal and my subconscious mind would push cigarette through my brain I could dissect each different smaller part and deal with them individually rather than as some monolithic monster For the last few days the withdraws are mild cravings are getting more and more sparse and the suggestions are inconsistent and weak However Yesterday and today I ve noticed a different kind of prompt and I wonder if ya ll have had it too This is clearly under the suggestion classification but it s not overt I find myself feeling like something is missing something is not present and I feel incomplete So I have coffee but I m not satisfied with it because it lacks something that leaves me feeling not whole The same with eating driving etc I notice it most when I m not in the moment when I m just mindlessly consuming my coffee one giant slurp at a time I m going to try to be more mindful to find the new things about my drinks meals etc that smoking deprived me of noticing in order to combat this subtle suggestion that is disrupting my peace If you have felt this to or have an idea of how to face it please let me know ,A New to Me Sensation days Completed ,0
2793, M started smoking casually at and daily from till now amp x B I m on my second read of Allen Carr s Easyway I read it about or years ago and loved it it really made me rethink my relationship with cigarettes In fact I don t think I ve ever truly enjoyed a cigarette since then but I never stopped smoking not even for a day amp x B As I m reading it now through a more adult lens I came across this paragraph amp x B Ask a smoker who believes he smokes only because he enjoys the taste and smell of tobacco If you cannot get your normal brand of cigarette and can only obtain a brand you find distasteful do you stop smoking No way A smoker will smoke old rope rather than abstain and it doesn t matter if you switch to roll ups mentholated cigarettes cigars or a pipe to begin with they taste awful but if you persevere you will learn to like them Smokers will even try to keep smoking during colds flu sore throats bronchitis and emphysema amp x B And I m realizing that no matter how much I ve thought about the nicotine addiction and brainwashing and actually AGREE with all of that I NEVER have those thoughts or attitude when the craving hits No matter how strongly I believe in that and how I m craving to be free from this shit forever and I know the smell and taste and feeling are downright disgusting I always end up lighting up another cigarette This would be more excusable if it happened in social settings but no I can t go more than an hour without smoking amp x B Sometimes I run out of tobacco and it all becomes very clear I just need to NOT buy more I won t smoke if I don t have them readily available I feel better already now that I don t HAVE to smoke another one While I m losing myself in these thoughts some part of my brain nicotine addiction is already driving me to the store amp x B How The Hell Does Anyone Do This amp x B If the nicotine withdrawal itself is mild according to the book then that leaves me with the psychological part of addiction It is so strong my tolerance for frustration is so low that I can t even imagine myself without smoking it s my crutch for everything particularly boredom and stress I fully understand what the book says about this smoking to relieve anxiety is a paradox However these argumentos have little to no effect the moment the thought of smoking pops in my mind amp x B How did you FINALLY convince yourself that enough is enough There is NOTHING I want more in my life right now than to drop this disgusting addiction ,I can t convince myself that I don t enjoy cigarettes ,0

2801,it started with a party last week havent been to one in like forever i quit everything for close to half a year i was sitting there with a friend of mine convinced i wouldnt get myself a beer thinking to myself what the fuck am i doing here Im young in university friends are around and places are opening up again and im here the most boring person at the location judging people for having fun one beer led to another and irresitable cravings took over me and i got myself a cigarette from someone and another one and we lit up a hookah it was so much fun being back with friends this evening was so much needed all good i thought not a big deal i treated myself once i have deserved this a friend of mine invited me for the next day to go drinking hell yeah i thought i was craving social connection so badly humans need social connection i dont think its healthy to life in total abstinence always husteling would have been real fucking valuable for me to hustle on because of so much wasted time in my teens due to some problemes and a huge problem with substance absue i was on such a successful way but this is still not the point were it got problematic again the next day comes around met with my friend and a few others drank some beery some harder stuff and my smoking totally escalated that night asked one stranger after the other for a cigarette anybody i could find to ask didnt even look them in the eyes anymore only on there hands if their holding one still this isnt the point where it got problematic what really got problematic is that i crossed the barrier of lighting my hookah up at my place every possible second while at home ever since its even at that point again where i think to myself that i dont want it i get headaches my lungs hurt and i dont get shit done but my stupid addicted brain only needs like minutes to change its mind and i prepare another head so i feel bad not too bad bit i know what im doing is not good at all i think the biggest problem is that i dont hate i enough to see the bad side of it yet nicotine addiction got its grip back on me in less than days i know what it feels like the mental aspect of not wanting it but still doing it and the physical sensation of nicotine withdrawl its back tomorrow im back awake and my mind is gonna trick me into consuming again i know none of your comments will stop me from doing so only i can stop myself the reason i consume is because i cant stand be be left alone with my thoughts when i know theres something more pleasurable whitch distracts me from my pain but i will embrace the pain i love pain pain makes a man i pushes me forward to new hights to reach impossible achievements and no fucking stupid useless substance is gonna stop me from doing so i want more from live than numbing pain with substances and being chained to my addiction i got a new therapist with whom i hopefully be able to work with successfully as much as i wish luck to myself i do wish it for you this is gonna be hard again but i will overfome this annoying sensation of withdrawl mostly need to work on how to connect with other young people without consuming but its everywhere and im so fucking lonely and unhappy about how hard it is to spend time with other young people and not consume any kind of substance feel like im missing out of so much fun only to realise the night out was totally annoying and not fun and i have to spend a whole day hungover and a full week tired and waste time and so on i want to build value now i harvest my compound interest achievements in the future hopefully i will be able to do so ,Hey guys i started smoking again and i fucking hate it,0

2806,I was a smoker for years pack a day for years First weeks were a hell of a ride for me but I made a huge path in these weeks in a matter of dealing with my own emotions and I feel good now Because nicotine is a drug It s weak but if you always smoke its effect is permanent You are in a constant clouded state of mind you do have distinct emotions but cigarettes blur them in one big goo That s why I smoked actually I had a lot of negative feelings and emotions that I wanted to blur I wanted to literally smoke make less vivid them But if you always smoke you can t deal with them and make they go through you just try to hide them so they always stay there making your life worse always keeping your level of psychological stress at a pretty high point Cigarettes just help you to have a constant emotional constipation I wasn t ready to deal with myself sober even months ago but now I realize that it s way better to stay sober I just don t like that clouded head space no more It takes time for your psyche to learn to process sober emotions but it s worth it And I wish to all of you the same thing ,I tried cigarette on my smoke free day and you know what I ll stay sober,0
2807,As much as I d want to say that being so close to a year milestone has made it easier to stay off of cigarettes it hasn t The first month was rough and I was irritable and anxious all the time made it feel like I wouldn t get past it But as time went on it did get easier for some time even past the month streak I was pretty amazed with myself and surprised that I had made it that long Around a month ago I started struggling with anxiety on a more regular basis I lost my job in July and I started taking some online classes a couple weeks ago but during that period between not working and not occupying my time with anything I started to feel the urge to go back to smoking really bad I ve struggled with bouts of anxiety before and usually when I did the cigarettes were always there for me Being a smoker for years they felt like they became a part of my identity It always felt like a crutch that could ground me and bring me back to reality when I was having excessive worry or intrusive thoughts Dealing with my anxiety this time around has been more sobering and difficult because I now always have the thought in my mind that I should just go buy a pack and start smoking to see if that helps There s other things I find myself doing that I didn t feel necessary when I started quitting like chewing more gum or putting a toothpick in my mouth Sometimes I ll just go out on the porch and pretend like I m smoking but just get some air instead I ll even act like I m holding a cigarette sometimes It s weird to think about how engrained that behavior of smoking became even though it s been almost a year since I had one it s just lately I ve been doing a lot of reminiscing on the times I was a smoker I know it s a big illusion that the addiction created but it really feels like a part of me is gone with the cigarettes out of my life Anyway just wanted to rant about this for a bit and see if anyone had any similar thoughts or experiences to share Good luck everyone and wishing you all the best ,Coming up on an year,0

2811,I m I work in healthcare and I m fucking done smoking I ve seen too many people on oxygen in the hospital because they have COPD and will spend the last years of their lives unable to breathe properly until they finally die an hypoxia related death I ve seen too many lung cancer patients coughing up blood and moaning in pain as they die a slow and painful death I ve seen to much judgement in the eyes of my fellow employees as they walk by me sucking down cigarettes too many people have looked at me like I m some sort of scum for doing it I m done letting this chemical have any sort of hold over me I m tired of feeling like a crazy person when I don t get a cigarette in every four hours I ve been smoke free cold turkey for about days now I already feel like I can breathe better I can taste food and coffee again I can smell my own farts again So far the biggest symptom has been that I feel less in control of my emotions Maybe this is how I felt before I started smoking and I was using nicotine to treat that in a way I don t remember Regardless I am glad that my meds have enabled me to do this with minimal physical withdrawal symptoms after the first two days besides my inability to sleep I m also proud of myself especially after today I had to drive for hours today and every part of me wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes before I left my home town I found myself trying to rationalize it Well maybe I can make a rule where I only smoke when I have a long car trip I ll throw the pack away when I get home but luckily I stopped myself Instead I bought a pack of gum I don t know why I m posting this mostly to share my success I m just proud of myself I guess and I want others on this sub who haven t quit yet and are looking for motivation to know that you can do this You are stronger than that fucking chemical and you will absolutely find yourself better for quitting It has barely been a week for me and already I ve seen marked improvement in my life Good luck ,This is it,0
2812,I just started on Nicorette gum The directions say to chew until you feel a tingle and then park it I feel no tingle If I continue to chew I eventually feel an itchy burning sensation in my mouth that reminds me of getting vape juice directly in my mouth I assume this is too much nicotine causing irritation The directions also say to not swallow the saliva while chewing the gum so should I be spitting every seconds Do I need to go out and buy a spittoon Is it possible my mouth produces too much saliva and as such the gum and lozenge will not work for me I tried a lozenge which said it should dissolve in minutes but it was gone in under minutes and I did not bite chew or suck on it just parked it ,What the hell do I do with all this saliva ,0
2813,Hi all so while being back home from studying abroad where I will return soon to finish my studies I ve noticed that the I ve been spending my days waking up eating breakfast and starting to smoke cigarettes Taking some breaks to be on my phone and around family and then again in minutes going back for a smoke In the evening I watch series on my laptop and browse the web but the very first thing on my mind when I wake up is thinking about smoking one and of course I need to smoke at least or before I go to bed This has become so weird and I sure know how addiction feels like as I m deep down into one I tell myself every night before going to sleep that I ll quit the next day or at least reduce the number of cigarettes smoked but when I wake up the urge is strong I m tired of it and on the other hand I m somehow used to being addicted and not doing anything all day but thinking about smoking and smoking I could spend all day just listening to music while having a cigarette Sometimes my teeth hurt and when I wake up in the morning or during the night to go to bathroom I m and I have the urge to pee almost every night or morning might be because of cigarettes but I m not sure sometimes I cough Sometimes my ribs hurt Something s not quite right with me I need help Thanks for reading,Feels like my entire day is built around smoking,0

2824,Day It is still hard i was born a smoker screamed until years old when I started smoking And i did for another At I was a smoker for longer than i wasn t And i loved it For so long But I ve seen the reflection when I m looking for them the crazy eyes the frantic movements the irritability the horrid feeling when you realise it is late you re out of them and everything is closed The lengths one goes to The wet hair smelling like death because you had to have one The shitty excuses to leave that everyone can see through The burned clothes The health damage The subhumanity It s literally just cigarettes It takes about days to be out of the worst I m out of the worst It is literally just a stinky habitual cancer stick and I want to quit forever It is a damn no brainer One cigarette is too much One thousand is never enough I m taking my fucking life back ,Cigarettes steal your peace of mind then sell it back to you one hit at a time ,0
2825,I ve tried to quit cold turkey in the past so many times Buying a pack smoking two or three then throwing the pack and the lighter away Going off the advice of Allen Carr I was determined to just rip out that nicotine drip But I kept coming back This might work for some people But what I realised after trying and failing literally maybe times was that I was sick of the sensation of smoking but not the nicotine The need for a nicotine was the only thing bringing me back So I finally dropped a load of money up front on a full course of nicotine patches plus gum I thought of it as an investment that would save me so much money in the long run if it works I m now five days in and haven t once wanted to smoke Yesterday I even took the patch off for about hours and still didn t want to smoke Once the familiar pinched feeling came again for a nicotine hit not for smoke in my lungs I slapped on another patch The thought of smoking made me feel physically sick Here s my point it s easy to think you re strong enough to quit cold turkey I kept kidding myself that I could tackle both the psychological and physical addiction at once But actually I needed to get used to a smoke free life I m already feeling the benefits I can breathe better I smell good I can smell things it was actually kind of an emotional Proustian moment to walk into a supermarket on day and actually smell the fruit and veg aisle There are no longer dark rings under my eyes I have more time I m happier Without the nicotine cravings I can see the cigarettes for what they actually are a filthy transmission method for a highly addictive substance Even if I m still popping nicotine gum in the months even years ahead it s a much better option than actively poisoning myself The reason that NRT is twice as effective is because it allows you to tackle the addiction by degrees For all the good that the cold turkey method is supposed to do I feel like the all or nothing approach isn t for everyone Like any big problem it can help to take it in smaller bites At least it seems to be working for me ,Nicotine replacement vs cold turkey,0

2835,Just wanted to share my experience with other redditors as it may be helpful Ideally I would have liked to put this post in the ADHD subreddit but quite likely it will get removed there as there is a policy against suggesting alternative treatments Also I remember reading somewhere that there is a strong correlation with people who have ADHD and picking up smoking Some info about myself I m in my early s I was diagnosed with ADHD early this year While I have struggled with ADHD throughout my life I did not have a proper diagnosis and could not receive a proper treatment Before the diagnosis I would use alcohol everyday to shut off my brain immediately after work I would also occasionally smoke cigarettes as they help me relax and focus I intentionally avoided depending on cigarettes for the fear of getting addicted I was prescribed adderall and initially I took it for weeks It helped a lot with focus and concentration but I felt it blunted my emotions and affected my sleep I thought at this point that perhaps I should just use tobacco since cigarette were so much more effective for me However genetic research I found that there are alternative ways to get tobacco that are not nearly as addictive That s how I came across the nicotine patch After experimenting with the dose a bit I settled on using a quarter of the mg patch every day I would put it on the first thing in the morning and take it off before going to bed I found myself much more comfortable with the nicotine patch than I did with adderall or without any medications I also do not have any urge to smoke cigarette or drink alcohol to shut down my brain in the evenings That is a clear improvement in my impulsivity and my mind is much more relaxed and focused The only downside I have seen is that I feel so relaxed and comfortable that I don t have much of a motivation or ambition I m not sure but this could just be my mind experiencing calmness for the first time rather than a lack of ambition Comparing to my mind in non medicated ADHD state back then I always wanted to do things at the same time Not having the same constant urge to do everything that catches my fancy it may be ambition lost for the better I have been using the nicotine patch for months now and don t see myself going back I ve also tried experimenting not using the patch after every few days and I can immediately see my mind if much less focused and impulsive when that happens ,Nicotine patch for ADHD,0
2836,Even as a young child I was in a smoke filled house and had lived and breathed second hand smoke until I started smoking myself My first puff was when I was five but I didn t start smoking full time until I was in my teens I d never been smoke free in any way until I quit in January and I did it cold turkey with no support network of any kind and I was around smokers and it was the easiest attempt I d ever made Now I m that annoying person who says If I can do it anyone can If you ve tried quitting you probably already know a lot of these thing but they don t click or you don t care We know it s bad It can kill us don t care It s a drain on finances so what Here s one you already know but don t fully appreciate the extent of it yet You stink I mean you really F n stink That ashtray you have outside that you wash very rarely That s is how you smell to others all the time Even now I occasionally get a slight whiff coming from my carpets despite never having smoked inside and having deep cleaned them repeatedly I feel physically sick when I do Brushing your teeth constantly and spraying perfume and deodorant work no more than they do in a toilet Now you just smell stupid Once you are smoke free you will immediately think back to all those non smoker friends family partners exes and wonder how they tolerated it You stink so much more than you realise amp x B You ll watch Youtube videos and read posts like these in forums and get that spurt of motivation which then dwindles You want to quit but it seems too hard or you really can t be bothered If you re like I was you re probably smoking as you read this When I say put it out ditch your smokes and become a non smoker right now you might want to but probably won t but it s really as simple as that You re a non smoker until you smoke again There s no such thing as quitting or cutting down You have everything you need to quit right now There is no easier time or date or setting Stopping right now is the biggest advantage you can give yourself as it is about doing new things and breaking your old habits Quitting later is your old habit and this is the first thing you need to change Stop deluding yourself and clinging onto things you think will make it easier as they only make it harder Don t set a time to start quitting don t cut down don t try weaning yourself off with gum and patches It s the slow bandaid but it does work for some however a little statistic based on my own experience and people I personally know is that of those people who relapsed after quitting were on gum patches nic vape and of those who have successfully quit never touched them and also changed their surroundings to help break their habits Quitting isn t about stopping an addiction it s mostly about breaking a habit which has slowly changed you without you realising it You need to reclaim and retrain your brain Nicotine is completely out your system in around five days or so and no matter what you think your body is telling you you no longer have a physical addiction You don t need it you just think you do The more you feel like you want to smoke and the stronger the urge the closer you actually are of being completely free of it It s the nictone death thrall When you re getting closer to being free of it it s the nicotine itself not the lack of nicotine that makes you feel crap without it in order for it to survive in your body Once you understand this it s easy to push through the urges as it s a sign that you are succeeding not a sign that you re dependant on it You probably already know this too Maybe you have quit and are a few days or weeks in so here is something else I ve said before to people changing the things you see every day help just as much sometimes more as changing what you do every day It s not just about taking a new route to work or trying a different supermarket or taking up new habits like exercise or drinking water Something as simple as changing your phone wallpaper is a good start Don t go back to one you liked before get something new something different Perhaps try something you don t particularly like as you need to get yourself out of your old mould Rearrange your furniture Change your curtains Use a new dining set rearrange the pictures you may have on display around the home reverse your bedroom layout and change your quilt covers Rearrange or replace your fridge magnets listen to music you would never listen to buy a brand of food you usually don t buy stop at that shop you pass by every day buy a new mop switch which drawer your clothes are in or better yet do a big cleanout No matter how small it is no matter how trivial even if it s something you don t realise you notice somewhere deep down in the recesses of your mind you have noticed it and this little change goes towards rewiring your mind Look at how much it costs you to smoke per week then look at something that costs the same If you were thinking of taking up a new hobby now is the time to start as you can afford it Put your money towards your new passion Just like your stench you probably don t realise how much money you are burning When I quit for the first few weeks months I would use my smoking money to reward myself with something new each week Sometimes saving up a few weeks and getting something big I would start buying new things to slowly replace what I already had so I was seeing new things every day which changed my mentality and attitude Got a new kettle okay I ll try a new brand of coffee new coffee Okay new mug One little thing opens up the path for another little thing It snowballs One day I was driving to the local shop for full cream milk for one of the seven coffees a day I was making with my new kettle the next thing I was walking there and buying light milk purely because it has a different label to the one I was used to seeing these little things really do help to make one of the two coffees a day I now drank I went from two teaspoons of sugar to half a teaspoon and I wasn t even trying to cut down or be healthy as it just happened once I started to change little things I saw every day around my home It all snowballs However there s also the health thing we all know about I knew but I didn t care I developed lung problems six months after I quit Who knows I might yet develop cancer down the track but at least I don t have these problems while still trying to quit while burning money It was actually the money that drove me to quit and it was having new things and fresh scenery that kept me off it I only really struggled the first five days but it was nothing like it had been the attempts beforehand This time it was different as I just stopped and saw nicotine as the little bastard it is I also hated being a slave to my smoking schedule and also the stigma of having society now ranking me below junkies as they are victims and smokers are apparently just selfish c nts It s not true and I still empathise with smokers but I was no longer going to give my money to tobacco companies and even more to the government so I could stand in an alleyway on my smoke break while paedos rapists and non smokers looked down on me for hiding myself away and minding my own business I had intended to cut down and set a start time st jan but on the th as I was halfway through the cigarette I would have before brushing my teeth before bed and something in my head said stop clinging to shit you think makes it easier as shortcuts now are long paths later Wanting to sleep but having to smoke first for what reason Brushing my teeth many times a day because of smokes Spraying deodorant to hide the unhideable Having to go outside in the cold to smoke Automatically deducting smoke money from my paycheck before food and bills Why was everything to my smoking schedule Why did every single photo of myself have me with a cigarette I put it out and as disgusting as it sounds I actually still have that half bitch wrapped up I immediately threw all my smokes out and in the following days I gave all my lighters and ashtrays away That next morning I craved a smoke I pulled out the wrapped half smoke and took a whiff and felt sick Then I pulled out all the crap from my cupboards and drawers and decided to just do what I had always put off Out with the old I changed my ringtone I changed my desktop wallpaper I thew out all the old crap in the freezer I rearranged furniture All the things I mentioned and it was this stuff that made it easier Seeing different things every day whilst still in my familiar environment was the kick I needed I would donate things I still used and needed in order to force myself to have to get new ones or at least replace them with different ones I d deliberately put myself in situations where I would have to walk or take the stairs instead of drive and take lifts and I started drinking water despite NEVER drinking water Really before my only intake was through coffee Changing your environment and the little things you see do and use every day is what will break your habit which is what quitting is all about It s all mental after the first week Ditch your smokes right now If you already have go make a huge mess in your bedroom forcing you to do a deep clean If it s clean then go attack that junk drawer or shed Anything no matter how small Rearrange things in your home move your lamps around put your spoons where your forks are and your forks where your knives are Rearrange any artwork or posters or even replace them and rearrange what s on your shelves change the radio station in your car eat somwhere different for lunch go online and look for a penpal or message a complete stranger grab a random book you know nothing about and start reading even if you don t read You can do the same things but do them differently you can live the same life but in a fresh environment Just imagine you are in a web and you need to move as randomly as possible to get out of it It doesn t need to be all at once but you need to change more than just stopping your smoking as in hindsight you will see how much your smoking has changed your life and habits bit by bit without you realising it so you need to do more than just stopping smoking and trying to tackle the sum of those changes in one go Start reversing that and get off of cigarettes schedule and create your own Obviously exercise is one thing that comes up and I know it s not an option for everyone so just walk No excuse unless you re in a wheelchair in which case just roll Already jog or roll Reverse your run path You ll make things much easier for yourself in the long run by making them harder in the beginning but don t forget to reward yourself just don t do it with food especially sugar as it goes hand in hand with nicotine You ll soon forget you are trying to quit as you will be adjusting to these new habits and changes while the other little things like the new morning alarm ringtone and that horrible incense you started using even though you hate incense start going to work on you without you realising it Changing things about yourself also changes how other people are towards you or what you talk about which in turn changes how you are Try new shampoo Get a new keyring Go to the pet store and buy the ugliest goldifish they have that nobody else will want and give it a home Change change change and new habits I started keeping the bottle caps from bottles of water for some unkown reason next thing I knew I had hundreds of them Ended up giving them to kindergartens for arts and crafts and still do it Feel free to develop temporary quirks or lean into existing ones One last thing I used to think I smoked more when stressed and it helped to relieve it and that seems to be the general consensus among smokers However I ve found it to be the opposite and I now see that studies have found the exact same thing Smoking does not reduce stress in the way we think it does Taking that break you take to have the smoke and breathing along with the temporary dopamine hit does but that s part of why we smoked in the first place It s all mind games but it s not until you are free of it all that you can see to what extent it all controls you I think back to chainsmoking when stressed and only ever feeling better temporarily which is a big difference from now as now I stress like normal people but am free to actually tackle issues and not smell while doing it I know it s a long rant and I ve probably repeated a lot as i just started typing without looking back but I ll leave it as is I only hope that even just one person will flick that switch in their head and realise that you really do have everything you need to quit right this very minute So stop with the excuses and stop waiting for the right time as that is all your enslaved mind talking I was the same and as I said I am now that annoying person who says If I can do it anyone can and that really is an understatement I was such a smoke addict that there are still friends and family who don t truly believe I ve quit like it s some ongoing prank Ditch the bitches and go out and buy yourself the ugliest toothbrush you can find It s something you see every day and will have a greater impact than buying one you like Good luck unless you are still putting it off in which case stop undermining yourself You probably don t like it when other people mistreat you or make you do things you don t want to do yet here you are doing it to yourself You probably know that too and don t care in which case just remember that you really REALLY f n stink and your deodorant cover up just makes you smell stupid ,Things I wish I d known and a lot of babble ,0

2840,Hi all I used to smoke consistently for about years The past years were probably the worst I was moving from a pack a day towards a pack and a few in the past year A long depression created a downwards smoking spiral years ago where I was having sleepless nights and I would grab my headphones and smoke cigs in a sitting outside until I was tired enough to go to bed and with lockdowns and wfh for a year and a half now it only got worse The past months I finally had enough I was feeling it was bad for me every morning I knew I couldn t continue like it I gave my cats food grab a drink and straight back out to smoke a cigarette sometimes I made it hours but Everytime I caved This week I faced I couldn t do it cold turkey I needed help So I bought weeks worth of patches and some nrt mints for sudden cravings I felt shame I had to admit I couldn t do it without My mom used to smoke she used the patches and I had the occasional streak of not smoking and she said something along the terms of you better not need patches to quit you are It haunted me for years I could do it myself how could I be so addicted and each time I failed within a few days the past months even hours But right now marks end of day without touching a cigarette it feels great It hasn t been without challenge but I truly feel I don t need them anymore I put the first one on and it took hours for me to walk to my balcony as an involuntary movement to smoke when I realized I don t really want one its just a habit The first day I made it through with one additional mint in the evening when the craving for worse I felt the craving used the mint and it went away Now day and I made it through without a mint not because i set myself up to not use them just the craving wasn t there I have had the occasional craving at traditional smoking moments for me before I start making dinner after I finished dinner when I stretch my legs after sitting down for an hour but all in all they are slowly getting less noticeable through the day The patches have a week plan weeks mg patches weeks mg and weeks mg I feel I could go faster but I am not going to I have tempted faith enough and I am not tempting it again to save a few s If this helps me quit it forever I ll happily pay for weeks worth of patches for weeks thats about week of my old smoking habit it s worth it I am worth it If only my foot would stop the nervous tapping I am sure that will go away soon ,End of day with nrt patches,0

2843,I m now and began smoking at to look cool and get all the chicks as one does I got up to about a pack a day at my peak but mostly hung around consistent homeostasis of cigs a day When I turned it began to feel extremely gross so I gave up regular chronic smoking and switched to having the occasional one while out drinking yadda yadda During the pandemic when all bars in my city were closed I began drinking more at home out of boredom and smoking in my living room and blowing the smoke out the window gross as shit I know I decided I was going to give up even occasional smoking for the highest quality of life possible better lung power for the gym no more stinking clothes or furniture not spending fucking dollars for smoking cigs out of the pack and angrily throwing the entire pack away the next morning etc etc Anyway feelin damn good for the most part Extremely cranky at certain points and accidentally snapped on a friend over text the other day and apologized But other than that I m giving myself slack to give in to cravings for sweets coffee sleeping in being distracted etc I have a great therapist I see weekly Welbutrin and Adderall both decrease my cravings for tobacco pretty significantly So yeah even if you re just an occasional social smoker outside the bar you should definitely still consider quitting ,Two Weeks No Death Sticks Babayyy,0

2851,This would be a long text I M starting smoking at age I didn t know until then there exist different brands or type of ciggarettes First ciggarette was smoked with a friend after school when going to home It was unpleasant and I didn t feel good tbh but after one day or two then I again smoked not because I liked it but kinda looking cool Then again now without a day break Initially thought this isn t addiction just to show off but it goes on Started smoking cigarettes for a day till year Then started smoking approx ciggarettes a day for the next year Later next year I joined college and I was feeling great because now I can smoke in my room as I moved to my hostel far from my home Started smoking weed in st year of college initially joint or roll but this started getting real and ciggarettes go to around maybe a day First two year of college went smooth as nothing is hitting hard in studies and kinda get average grades I was good in athletics until high school but started smoking my breathes keeps getting shorter and in college I tried to fit in schedule I left every sport because of smoking breathing issues I started feeling slow and heavy because a bit worry and ciggarette rd year I finally trying not to smoke or if I do only max but failed nearly everyday for six month Nothing worked a bit Used videos on YouTube and read blogs but practically I break every vow made to myself Every week I said this will be last and rd day I smoke Then comes my final year in college it was a disaster as company firms start recruiting from my college then I face backlash at every point starting from not good academics no extracurricular body posture not great and stamina Every time I feel a bit less ciggarette was there to provide support I feel at that time So my last semester I started having pain in my heart but ignored should never do ever Then feel if I don t quit this time then it would be lethal and tried again but again failed for times It was March last year then lockdown I came home but with hope that I never smoke again and damn it was somehow worked this time For straight months strict lockdown no shops open though I have tried to get ciggarette but thankfully failed every time for two months After that I am at home working online got job in a online interview and no ciggarettes till now Things that may have worked for me but could help you Mindset You have to say that I can and you will In my case I failed many times but finally done it Do tell youself every time you smoke that this is not good I know it is hard Avoid triggers find which triggers you and remove that part with something else Eg Mine was when I was exhaust doing something with mind For this I break the concentration for sometime drink water and then back and other trigger when I saw smoking or near smoke Friends and emotional support very important but not worked well for me My friends helped but they aren t quitting and majority of time I failed because of my friends because when I see them I get trigger I have sacrificed but it pays back now My friends tried to morally support me but no help there I made distance a bit to my friends this was painful but we are good Exercise and food They are useful but mind don t want that I made excuse to me it is ok I am young I didn t need and They will work only if you by slowly day by day Starting slowly but consistent Remember this has practically worked for me and not from some article Each day is important Each day Stretching I separate it from exercise because you don t need go for explicitly streteching You can do it anywhere Neck stretching is games changer When feel to smoke stretch Alcohol and weed increases amount of ciggarettes These are main factors but small bits also helped as this post is pretty lengthy now itself so if you want ask anything feel free I know there are smokers for about lifetime and don t have any major problem but remember everyone is different and their genetics Smoking help you think is my most apologetic excuse to smoke again but in long run it will not help I assure as much I have experienced Stay healthy and quit today because tomorrow Thank you for reading and this community is great I wish I joined earlier English is my second language if any mistake I apologize ,Smoking is not cool and affects your lifestyle,0

2855,I ve been smoking cigarettes for six years Like most I tried to quit smoking but it didn t help me In fact out of the six years that I smoke I ve been trying to quit for two My problem is that if I don t smoke for a long time I start eating everything I m sure that I m not the only one with such a problem Recently my friend gave me a good idea to buy a Juul My friend has been smoking Juul for quite a long time and every time I forget my cigarettes and this happens quite often I take the device and make a couple of puffs By the way ironically I gave him a Juul to stop smoking cigarettes So it happened that now he belongs to a group of people who like to smoke delicious liquid and exhale pleasantly smelling smoke I think smoking Juul is much more convenient than cigarettes since I can take a liquid containing Cannabis or other delicious additives I read that the liquids for vape Juul have cannabidiol and cannabidiol is a drug contained in plants from the genus of hemp It increases the heart rate excites the body and relaxes the nervous system It s precisely the effect I want to experience after smoking I m interested in people s opinions about smoking Juul and vaping in general and would really appreciate tips on how I can get vaping products with Cannabis to chill and relax Thank again for taking your time to read and for any advice you could offer ,Will smoking Juul help get rid of the habit of smoking cigarettes ,0

2857,I accidentally stumbled on this subreddit and it gave me the urge to share my story I don t know if this could help people in your journey but I hope it does give a bit of encouragement During the last years of college was a different time for me Had good and bad friends experienced one of the most memorable times and worst times of my life Got the habit of drinking and of course smoking I struggled to fix myself right after that but I did Vaping actually help me with it I went from packs a day to getting the highest nic juice and started going down from there There came a point where it didn t gave me dopamine any longer or to be more exact it became tedious cleaning my vape buying that once tasty vape juice till I got the vaper s tongue and seeing my hard earned money going out in a puff of water vapor However I realized one thing after that I never experience relapse Somehow vaping ease it out for me like how you would slowly quit smoking from pack to a few sticks a day I still get that urge now and then to smoke of course On the first year of quitting seeing people smoke made me go a bit crazy but I held on Now I m happy to say that I m free of it It s like I was back to those days when I was young when I see people smoking and hate the damn odor and stay the hell away from it while wondering why do people smoke I persevered on my own and made the decision to quit myself No one pushed me my family never new I smoke until I told them a month after I stopped I just wanted to back to the days that I am the one in control of myself and not anything and anyone else Now it s been years but I ll stop counting Forget it about it all and not say I stopped smoking to I don t smoke amp x B TL DR Never puff a cig e cig for years and vaping helped , years since I ve stopped smoking due to vaping ,0

2859,Hey everyone As the post title says I have been smoke free for weeks Up until the end of July I was smoking heavily before starting my quit with the level patch I did sneak one cigarette after a week so I reset my quit date but have not smoked since then Once I ran out of the patches I switched to the mg mini lozenge which I preferred since it allowed me to experience the withdrawals and satisfy some of the ritualistic parts of smoking I only used about lozenges per day as opposed to smoking an entire pack I allowed myself to run out of all nicotine products a little over weeks ago and have been nicotine free since then Those final hours were not that bad Some anxiety and restlessness but I was in a situation that allowed me to literally avoid people the entire time so my external triggers were very limited While I did have a little too much time to overthink there was no way for me to obtain any cigarettes or nicotine products so I had to just deal with it Now I do have access to smoking but also a solid support network and commitment to staying smoke and nicotine free I have been able to drink alcohol and be around other smokers without relapsing I have had cravings and will continue to for a time but I feel confident in my ability to stay smoke free I have been reading Alan Carr s book though surprisingly I haven t finished it yet I plan to but haven t needed to lean on it as much as I expected I m just happy to be this far along It is possible even if you relapsed after many years like I did TL DR weeks smoke free weeks nicotine free , weeks smoke free,0

2876,Hope ya ll are having a great Tuesday morning So I quit smoking July th of But about months later dealt with something that shook me and resulted in me smoking about a half pack in two hours or so I realized I made a big mistake and threw the rest out That was the last time I smoked which was about a year ago don t remember exact date I ve quit several times in the past ish months max where a fuck up would almost guarantee me becoming a smoker again It was extremely important that I did not psychologically start over or start from scratch because of the relapse because It s inaccurate I had been quit for two months and was used to being a non smoker If I started smoking again I would be starting over as a smoker Staying quit would be me continuing being a non smoker Additionally I hadn t built up the physical addiction nor patters of a smoker even if I smoked a half pack I did not re pavlov dog myself If my attitude had been that I had thrown it all away I would be more down in the dumps and more likely to say might has well have another since I m starting over anyway The important thing is you don t have another and not undo all your work you ve done by becoming a smoker again While I think it s important you don t allow yourself to smoke it s also important to be easy and on yourself and realistic about the situation if you do ,Thoughts on approaching relapses,0
2877,Hi all I M have once again decided to break these shackles of addiction I first started smoking when I was and have been smoking close to packs a day for the past years I have been trying to quit for around months now failing everyday My longest quit lasted days After close to failed attempts I decided to give myself a week smoking pass and then put out my final one minutes ago I want to quit because I spend way too much time on smoking close to days a month according to my app This affects my ability to work even when I am working and not smoking all I can think about is my next smoke I tend to take a break every minutes for a smoke so as you can imagine I can barely get anything done As the frequency of my smoking increased I started feeling very tired came down from working out days a week to probably times a month All these constant failures in quitting smoking have taken a huge toll at my self esteem From being a very confident guy I have now become someone who s scared of taking up even the simplest of challenges I have decided I can t live like this This needs to change my life needs to change I want to focused confident and fit again That s why I am giving myself one more chance and I hope this is the last attempt of my life ,Here it goes I put out my final cigarette,0

2888,I f am taking another attempt to quit smoking I have the problem that I am also smoking in my apartment Remaining concentrated during home office is one big difficulty that I need to overcome Additionally I want to finish writing my phd thesis Some might argue that it is not the best time to quit however I don t enjoy smoking at all anymore I feel with every cigarette that I am just doing this because of the craving I can go for hours without cig if I do something physically somewhat active However in front of the monitor and the meetings I have the urge to smoke basically almost all the time Additionally I developed unhealthy eating habits in the last year because I often smoke instead of eat and probably also subconsciously use the cigs for blood sugar control and my cigarettes have increased from up to sometimes in the last months Moreover I have thyroid issues and the recovery of the thyroid function in the first three months is at least at parts responsible for what we experience as withdrawal Cigs interfere with thyroid function in many different ways I also get blisters on the lips brain fog heavy PMS very emotionally unstable panic attacks when quitting for some weeks All this makes it a bit difficult for me to quit while I still need to perform well enough every day I tackled a lot of my health issues with supplements and diet and I would like to go the next step to break free from this addiction I really do not want to continue smoking because in the long run the negative effects definitely outweigh the shortterm avoidance of a difficult withdrawal and I can t stand the smell of the smoke everywhere anymore It is disgusting I came across this talk by Dr Andrew Pipe https youtu be nUDS g Uc and he explains very well how NRT need to be individually adjusted on order to be beneficial for individual people by first dosing high enough and then second decrease the dose in little steps So I will give this a try I will not quit immediately but use the NRT to first reduce the amount of cigarettes daily once I have found a more or less stable dose with the patches I will replace single cigarettes with gum whenever possible I had some old patches still at home way over their shelf life but I thought worst case they are inefficient and I tried them since they weekend Since they are mg only I observed when I would return to the frequency of approximately one every minutes and noted that this is the case after approximately hours then I use a new mg patch Let s say that until now I can say that the urges have drastically decreased and I feel a kind of peace and inner relaxation that I did not have for a very long time I am writing this OP as kind of a documentation of my own path for all of those that are interested in the approach and are in a similar difficult situation I am nit going to argue the quit once and for all approach I tried for years had weeks without cigarettes and it always affected my daily performance in a way that was actually intolerable Maybe I am too weak or the complexity of the other issues makes it too difficult for me The once and for all approach did not work for me and this is exactly the argument Piper makes in his talk If something didn t work several times then maybe it is times to try something different Best wishes to all of you I hope I will be successfull and I hope that this will help others as well ,Try again with NRT,0

2900,I m sick of being a smoker I want to get rid of this habit that lives in my head all the time and makes me feel like a slave I m years old and have smoked since I was on average a pack of cigarettes a day I ve tried to quit several times in recent years the last time I managed to stay for fifteen days I was feeling very good my energy for physical activities improved a lot my nights sleep despite waking up all night and having nightmares the next morning I felt so good like I had more oxygen in my body and my heart was doing the right job It s not easy in my family many people have died from cancer and there are still many people who still smoke it seems that the plug doesn t fall on my conscience and makes me have a willpower to overcome this addiction Every time I try to stop I come back because I have problems with alcohol too I m an alcoholic I m drinking on average three times a week usually until I lose consciousness This has affected my life in many ways I am single without friends without purpose in life Just waking up working exercising and doing it all on autopilot I know I need to change and act soon because the disease of alcoholism is going to get worse But every week my brain tortures me saying it s okay if I go out and have a few beers I know I ll never drink small amounts the word moderation doesn t exist in my vocabulary Do I need to wait for the worst to happen and hit rock bottom I do not think so My decision comes from now and I would like to follow it through the next few months and see how my life will change It s a lonely process and since I don t have friends anymore I ll have to trust myself have the necessary willpower and do what needs to be done to keep a sober life this is my wish I would like to meet new people who are not drinking or smoking most of my friendships were made in this environment and today I am a little lost and anxious for not having given me the opportunity to make this decision before Better today than tomorrow Send me positive energies ,My wish is to have a sober life ,0
2901,Does anyone know the availability of these in the US I have searched and searched Has anyone gotten a prescription recently I just want to make sure before I make an appointment at the doctor ,Chantix Champix availability ,0
2902,I F stated vaping after someone close to me gave me one about months ago I ve been buying ever since and all while telling myself I m not addicted I seriously lied to myself I ve seen what cigarettes can do to people I don t want to get that bad I go through a fume ultra hit disposable or similar in a week or recently even less time then that Not only that but I ve noticed I don t eat when I m stressed anymore think I may have some kind of eating disorder It makes me feel better about myself even though I know vaping might have more serious consequences It s something I ve been working on but I think Ive only replaced one problem addiction with a worse one I ve tried to quit vaping twice to no avail and I unintentionally go to vape after so many hours without It s like I get a craving and there s no in between stage of realizing oh I m getting a craving so I just get up and go I don t know how to be more conscious of that in between moment If I don t vape I get mood swings and nausea If I do I only get a headache but feel better mentally obviously that s what an addiction is Essentially I m asking for advice How do I quit by myself or get help outside of parents guardians I have big plans for myself and nic addiction is the last thing I need holding me back I would never forgive myself Hope this all makes sense and any advice is greatly appreciated ,I ve come to terms with my being addicted now I need to stop it,0
2903,I started smoking in high school around and smoked until when I finally decided to quit I asked my doctor to put me on Champix which helped and then became nicotine free until months ago I m very disappointed in myself and I can t shake the feeling now when ever I get a chance when I get extremely anxious I break down and smoke the place where I work doesn t help either Please help me in the right direction again I feel like a failure every time I light up a cigarette ,Hello I started smoking again after quitting the first time years ago ,0
2904, okay hear me out I m gonna quit eventually I don t actually smoke I ve been using strong snus for a couple of years and I have a bag in my lip almost throughout the day Physically I m more addicted than an average smoker Today I ve managed to take only one bag in the morning The rest of the day has been uff okay I m not in a hurry but I don t want to be addicted rest of my life Right now I m going through a rough patch in life that takes it s toll on my energy so going cold turkey could add up to that Any idea if I start taking taking a hit of nicotine only in the morning to break some of the habit and eventually quit altogether Anyone did this with smoking Or will this just make me irritated for months until I really quit Cheers guys ,Only use in the morning ,0
2905,Why is stopping smoking so much more difficult than quitting drinking I ve been sober for months with zero relapses Don t even so much as think about alcohol in my day to day anymore Every time I try and stop smoking I end up going back This shouldn t be that difficult ,Why is this so much harder ,0

2907,Hello Team r stopsmoking and welcome to my TedTalk This is a little vent from which I need reassurance tough love and common sense Perhaps at the end some concrete tips First though the part you skip if you re a fan of tl dr I stopped smoking on the of April It was a fantastic choice I didn t want to be a year old smoker and to an extent I have been successful For nearly five months I just didn t smoke The first or weeks were a bit of a ball ache but I could push through I had reduced my daily smoking heavily in the build up and was averaging cigarettes daily before the quit as a result the withdrawal symptoms were I imagine quite mild I ate a bit more gained some weight and then carried on Imagine the pride I felt years of smoking cigarettes and not wanting to and finally I had fingers firmly hooked into my bootstraps pulling me to where I wanted to be It was good and I had stopped thinking about it apart from brief cravings of a few seconds These served more as a reminder that I used to smoke than a reason to begin again So imagine my dismay today realising that I am back on track to making one of the most stupid decisions of my lifetime AGAIN I MEAN WHAT SORT OF FUCKING IMBECILE MANAGES TO KICK THESE BASTARDING DEATH STICKS AND But anger towards myself won t help much I believe I am a flawed human and flawed humans don t respond well to emotional criticism I was with a girl I like this girl This girl smoked This girl introduced me to friends of hers They smoked We sat outside in the grass at a music festival They smoked We wore black We appreciated how good we have it by lamenting how bad others did We drank alcohol At some stage in the night this girl lit a cigarette and a thousand details came together in my mind She looked sexy it smelled good we were giving the world a middle finger because we weren t allowed to care about something as trivial as our bodies when there was so much else happening I ll stop now because I am aware that I am to an extent romanticising a nicotine high and addiction This is why I took the cigarette though I took two more that night I was aware that I did not want to smoke and I was aware that I had no physical urge to do so I very simply just felt like it hence my description above Last Wednesday and Thursday I smoked more cigarettes I think I was at a training course for work and we drank in the evenings I ve seen too many of my friends in recent years go from people who only smoked at parties and bummed fags to regular smokers None of them wanted to They all thought they had it under control For many it was a long slow descent into dependency I reckon my history with tobacco would arrange a speedier recession into addiction Here I am then back with you beautiful people Fuck this for a lark It s not worth the pretty girls and collective nihilism It s definitely not worth the yellow teeth and smelly clothes standing in the cold with a blocked nose I cannot yet reset my quit date I remain proud of the th of April That was the day I began having more days without cigarettes in my life than with But I crave accountability too Does anyone have an all suggestion for me in which I can work in a relapse take the relapse seriously but not reset all the progress I made I have not damaged my lungs to the same extent I did over years of smoking with these cigarettes and I would like a smoking app or tool that reflects that Thanks for listening and I hope to see you below Yours u buttplugsrme,Smoking with alcohol,0

2911,Huh,What,0
2912,I m quitting today for the last time I realized that a lot of US culture just likes to make things sound hard and turn them into some kind of heroic quest But a lot of stuff just isn t that hard or heroic it s only slightly uncomfortable The tobacco industry also has a strong interest in telling you nicotine is super addictive and impossible to quit I think it s just not true All I have to do is occupy myself for minutes or bad days or whatever at worst After days the nicotine is long gone and the nicotine addiction is barely an itch it s not some crazy monster like meth Join me in actually quitting is easy and life just isn t that hard take it easy lol gang ,Maybe quitting is easy,0
2913,So I have been trying to quit for a few years now started vaping but still had the occasional cigarette At the same time I ve taken up weight lifting to try to reduce some of my body fat and it just didn t seem to budge even with a very strict diet of mainly protein amp x B Then I started googling and found smoking has been linked with abdominal fat Does anyone know if it s the nicotine that messes up my fat storage or can I continue vaping and quit cigarettes completely and expect abdominal fat loss I m very scared of quitting cold turkey had a really bad experience a few years ago where I for real couldn t shit for weeks amp x B Cheers,Question about smoking vaping linked to weight loss,0

2921,Help My body and mind are craving so bad but it literally makes me vom and have a mega light sensitive headache Why is my mind and body doing this to me F off Argh What a horrible addiction this is ,Smoking is now a migraine trigger But mind and body trolling me ,0
2922,Hello I quit smoking days ago I am able to handle everything without much difficulty In fact I know from previous experience that I have no problem quitting smoking per se The problem I have is that I lose concentration and the ability to concentrate Writing this has taken a lot of conscious effort amp x B I do a job where concentration creativity and problem solving skills are essential Do you have any experience of this Any useful advice amp x B Thank you very much ,Concentration and attention do they come back like when you smoke ,0
2923,This quit attempt has been different I ve been listening to Alan Carr s Easy Way to Stop Smoking finished it and threw my pack and lighters away I didn t do it because that s what s expected or asked but because I knew at that point after almost years of smoking I was no longer a smoker I set my no smoke app timer which for me doesn t so much represent how much time my willpower has held out as much as it represents how long I ve been a non smoker from that point on to commemoratethe transition That was hours ago I of course still feel cravings same strength as the ones that didn t wake me up from my hours of ugly sleep every night I still feel light withdraws and my subconscious still sends weak sauce suggestions but I don t have that brainwashed dialog wreckin my day I m not feeling anxious or deprived I m genuinely happy I feel good and I have no desire to smoke ever again So this afternoon I got what I would have considered the BIG test during my previous quits I went shopping and my car fob slid out my shorts pocket and under the seat I bent over and saw one camel blue short next to a green mini bic lighter The occasion only missed the slight scent of sulfur and a low demonic cackle to turn it into a cliche movie temptation My first thought was damn I m really not a smoker anymore I don t know how many of you have had the degrading experience of tearing aparr your car during a quit or just a day when you were gonna be out of smokes for awhile hoping to find a pack with one cig left or a half smoked cigarette in the ashtray but I ve had that humiliating experience Many times When I saw that camel blue and lighter I realized I hadn t combed through my car this time Hadn t even considered it I then threw the cig and flick away without a problem It wasn t even a temptation I have to emphasize this has never been my experience before and I ve tried to quit a brazillion times I also want to recognize the percentage of smokes who read the book and don t find it easy the first time keep up the tries I believe in you I also want to say I know I m just one cigarette away from falling back into the trap being a smoker again and needing to stop Again Relapse is the norm and should be a part of rehabilitation But right now I feel like celebrating I m really happy I m wishing everyone who is stopping myself included this happiness from now on I m rooting for ya ll ,Today I consider myself a confirmed non smoker,0
2924,I went over days without smoking and started smoking socially again whilst on holiday with a group of smokers On my way back I bought a sleeve of cigarettes to give to another mate as a gift and instead of giving them to him I started smoking them myself It s only been a month since I ve been back and already I m smoking a day again on average Resetting my smoke free days on the app will be absolutely demoralising but I have no one to blame other than myself The motto not another puff no matter what is SO true Learn from my mistake after a certain point you will get so complacent that you think you could smoke in a day for a weekend and not get addicted But before long you ll start rationalising smoking to yourself again and because it s been so long since you last smoked you ll have forgotten most of the negatives of it Starting from now I will be quitting again I m hoping this time around it will not be as difficult especially as most of the negative habits haven t formed yet But man does it feel shit to be back on day zero again ,Relapsed after days,0
2925,That shit HURTS I cannot believe that I was able to smoke that strength of nicotine when I used to smoke It wasn t even enjoyable at all Just horrible pain in my throat as I was trying not to die from smoke inhalation Thank god I am not a smoker anymore,I took a rip of a juul after days clean while drunk,0

2927,So months back I stopped smoking I had quit and started smoking again in past since over a year I was trying to smoke one day I just said F it whatever cravings I get bring it on I don t want to screw up my health anymore so from March st week I stopped smoking I would usually spend around to CAD per month smoking a sticks pack in days and pack costs for pall mall blue to motivate myself I purchased a glass jar I would put in it per week as a symbol of how much I didn t spend on smoking the first week was the most difficult I didn t get so much of physical cravings like stomach pain or headache my symptoms were more like restlessness couldn t sleep uneasiness I would get angry quite easily but that was only for week and I was smoking for around to years after the st week things started to get good my brain fog started to clear up I never knew I had such a thing I felt lightheaded I could think clearly without getting angry I just felt a big weight has been lifted away from me so I started taking evening walks before I never felt like walking or going out since my work is from home now and from that initial week of torture after that everything is good at times I would crave it while I m watching movie and I see someone smoke or while I was stressed but I did not give up I was more curious to see how my body mind felt when I m off nicotine because since years old I am smoking everyday for years now cigarette had become such an everyday thing that I couldn t imagine life outside of it now months later I see the glass jar in front of me in which I used to put my cigarette money when I didn t smoke now it has totalled to around I could not imagine I was spending so much on nicotine now I am planning to buy myself a gaming pc this Christmas if you re a person who s struggling with quitting smoking imagine if you could buy a gaming pc or any other thing for free just by saving your smoke money ,my quit smoking story,0

2933,Hello everyone This is my three week update Here are my introductory https www reddit com r stopsmoking comments p mbpk advice and encouragement needed one week https www reddit com r stopsmoking comments pdwrih one week update and two week https www reddit com r stopsmoking comments pif tx two week update posts if you are interested in my journey if not this post should serve well as a stand alone too Unlike last week I had zero things that could remotely resemble cravings I m free it s over For those of you thinking about quitting or early on in I think it needs to be emphasized how excellent it is to not be a smoker I speak with a lot of people and share various experiences about a lot of topics so although I haven t personally experienced every one of these things I feel confident with the ones I have and the way the others have been described to me to say that all of these are in the ballpark of what it is like to be done with cigarettes If you have done any of these things feel free to add Getting glasses or even getting lasik Either way you can literally see the world in a way you never have before No more being a slave to bad eyesight or pair of glasses contacts Every aspect of your daily life is instantly improved by the eye sight you should have always had Imagine living your life thinking your vision was fine only to discover that it is so much better You d be ecstatic Building an emergency fund Or becoming debt free Personally I have never found an unexpected problem that doesn t fix Of course I don t have a family so my number could probably be lower than that but I like the security Point being this is another thing that completely changes your life for the better Car breaks Unexpected bill Covid Layoff etc It s amazing what this one feels like There s no more money stress I got this one out of the way early but there was a time in my college days where I was so stressed about money than I would literally have dreams at night about still not having to buy a coffee Once I decided enough was enough and put everything into saving cash for these problems the problems stopped happening Getting fit Even just mildly This is a good one too I ve never been fat personally but I have been so out of shape that it was almost as bad Getting off the couch getting out of bed just anything that involved any sort of voluntary movement seemed like such an inconvenience After just a few sessions at the gym and it doesn t matter what kind of workout you do as long as it s something it will work You ll get your life back and instead of making a face expressing that you want the asker to ensure that it is something important when asking you to get off your ass to do something simple you ll leap at it because not only is it easy but it is also fun to help someone They wouldn t ask if they didn t need your help Getting out of jail like I said I talk to a lot of people with very unique experiences Or escaping Poland in the Soviet ages All of these things result in the same feeling the freedom The getting your life back The Air smells good the lighting is more vibrant you want to jump for joy and you actually can You re not trapped and you realize that you never had to be I m sure there are countless others and it s probably easier to just ask what the best moment or lifestyle adjustment you ve ever made was and tell you that smoking can t be topped only matched It s wonderful amp x B It s only been three weeks since I ve had a smoke or any form of nicotine but it actually feels like a distant memory now Not that I was a smoker but the act of lighting one up and inhaling the smoke Right now that act seems so out of the question that it s hard to imagine actually doing I guess that that is to be expected when I have not smoked the cigarettes that I would have smoked over that amount of time And yes that is truly insane smokes Never again One thing that I think Allen Carr understated although still emphasized in his book was the relation to will power He pointed out that it takes willpower to start smoking in the first place and it was very easy to nod along to that Not a single aspect of smoking is actually enjoyable until you re addicted to the nicotine and yet we worked hard to get to that point Why I m not sure but anecdotally I thought about every smoker I knew It was just most of them it was ALL of them who could be accurately described as strong willed I can only speak for myself there but I have a hunch that most people would draw a similar conclusion when thinking of the smokers they know Maybe there s one or two out there somewhere who aren t headstrong maybe My Ferrari fund is now at over after the three weeks Mathematically there s still no reason I won t be able to buy a supercar at some point in my life with this fund built with money saved from smoking I m going to love this but already I find it hard to imagine that I will enjoy it more than being free from smoking It s also amazing how little I go into gas stations I think I may have actually been inside one once since my last smoke Usually just pay at the pump don t deal with those damn lottery ticket people lines etc The smoke free app doesn t calculate the time saved from that into their models but calling that minutes per day doesn t seem unreasonable Finally today is the start of football This is going to be interesting because NFL games have LOTS of time for smoking I used to constantly smoke while watching football Especially up here in Canada See we get Canadian commercials and they re repetitive and terrible We re get the good doctor a virgin moblie expedia a truck commercial and an NFL shop one during every single commercial break Quite often these commercials will play more that once in each break The jingles in your head are so irritating after an hour that you have to mute the TV This is also why I don t miss watching anything on The Paramount Network where their ads are all just clips of their own shows Sometimes even while you re watching that exact show That was an interesting post for my three week update I came in without having a lot to say and rambled hopefully it was at least entertaining The truth is it s hard to keep writing specifically about not smoking as it s become such a non issue after three weeks Once you kill your addiction I called mine The Dirty Bastard by starving it to death via not letting it have what it wants there isn t anything that would make you want to be a smoker There just isn t I ll never be a smoker again and nothing about that seems uncomfortable or even anything short of the best feeling there is Thanks again for sticking along for the journey If you have anything to add please do so I ll keep these posts up if I can but some will turn into rambles like this Any time I spend rambling is still better than any time spent smoking ,Three Week Update,0

2936,Hi All I ve been a smoker for about twenty years In recent years I would typically smoke cigarettes a day Today I ve been smoke free for five days I m using the mg nicotine patches which appear to work so well that I hardly notice anything There was just one occasion yesterday where after a couple of beers it was hard to resist the urge to bum a cigarette but I managed in the end Other than that I feel like having instantly become a non smoker without suffering any unpleasant side effect Is this normal I was planning to follow the suggested programme of weeks of mg and weeks of mg but I feel like perhaps I can already switch to the mg ones much earlier Has anyone had similar experiences ,Using patches at the moment Feels like it s too easy ,0

2939,Hi there stopsmoking community Endless gratitude for the advice support and stories on this journey of self improvement This is my personal experience in case it can help someone along the way get through even one craving from a year smoker and year vaper Wanting to Quit felt so shameful embarrassed about this habit I was always ended up lying to friends families and coworkers to sneak out to get a fix awful migraines on the daily it s expensive Living in NYC on a modest salary I cut corners on almost everything but justify spending every two days on nicotine This is a month a year I would bust my ass off at work for a k raise felt my mood was dependent on a drug Quitting I have many attempts of quitting smoking before but don t like to see them as failed attempts That day streak is still days I didn t smoke Progress isn t always linear Some people can quit first time cold turkey and that s incredible But I am not one of those people I try to look at it as if it s a workout I wouldn t expect to get my goal mile time the first try but that doesn t mean that I am doomed and should give up Please keep trying the reason I always end up smoking again is because I can t stand being irritable I m trying to identify my triggers and find replacement behaviors Recognizing my weak moments makes me actively try harder in those times I end my quits by taking just one puff which ALWAYS leads to the habit again I either bum off a friend or tell myself it s ok to treat myself just this one time You are lying to yourself If you never make that micro decision for one more puff you won t fall back into the trap Resources Allen Carr s Easy Way This is not a magic book I read and immediately found it easy to quit nor do I use all his techniques but am at least armed with the knowledge Just get the book You can sometimes find it at the library even It is probably hours of your life that you would ve been on Reddit anyway Main takeaway is that nicotine does nothing for you except bring a tiny bit of relief that nicotine caused in the first place paradoxically the feeling a non smoker has all the time patches and nicotine lozenges I ve done the patch before and didn t have intense cravings and mostly even forgot about smoking after a week or so This is the first time I m doing two types mg patch for a week now at mg and maybe two mg lozenges throughout the day I haven t had any really bad cravings Even stepping down was fine I was kind of moody for the day but nothing dramatic Can update when I am completely free from NRT sorry Allen Carr workout Do a YouTube workout take a run do some squats Whatever works for you to exert your body somehow and get that sweet endorphin release SmokeFree app Satisfying timers to keep track of your quit time little daily missions and things to scroll through while you have a craving helps a ton journal Write down your reasons struggles and benefits This is really cathartic for me All these things book NRT week SmokeFree app STILL cheaper than smoking I believe in you don t give up you will be so proud of yourself I am proud of you si se puede ,Day th attempt thoughts ,0
2940,I was bored I wanted to entertain myself I live in quite small town and there are not so much options to entertain yourself I figured out there is something like speaking club for those who want to learn english in some government library I wasn t really interested in learning english I just wanted to get some interaction with human beings So I went there I came too early and I was seating alone in a big room There were tons of very old dusty magazines on shelves People were coming but somehow they all seemed kind of ugly to me Everything seemed ugly I wanted to smoke so much just one puff I understood that I can t stand being in this room with those people anymore I got out On a way home I wanted to smoke so much but I was repeating to myself something like it s easy to start smoking and it will be not easy to quit again I called my friend and felt better somehow Weekends are tough for me,Almost started to smoke again on day ,0

2942,Older dude checking in I started smoking when I was about because I thought it was cool Fast forward years and I have smoked well over cigarettes Well that was stupid I successfully quit once when I had my first kid I started again when I lost my second Fast forward a few years and my kid isn t far from leaving home for university I m tired my body aches even though I get lots of exercise I worry about cardio vascular issues when I wake up with tingling hands I m single and smoking hinders my options and I m not going to lie or try and hide the fact I stink smoking is expensive and times are tough these days I m getting and feeling old But I m not giving in I ve spent the last few months losing weight getting stronger learning about all sorts of new stuff getting better at my job becoming more empathic and passionate Nicotine is my last anchor and has been the majority cause for the remainder of my problems It s made me sick and has been keeping my sick for decades By chance I stumbled upon the quitsure app no affiliation and it s free and for the first time I ve been able to understand nicotine and be honest with myself about my smoking Diving into the psychological side of nicotine addiction has made the step of quitting so much simpler I ve tried and failed with NRT vaping cold turkey and reduction all of which in hindsight seem like silly things to do now that I understand how nicotine works in my body and brain I am now well equipped to spend the rest of my life as a non smoker in fact the though of a smoke disgusts me I am free Here s to a better life for all of us tldr understanding nicotine the way it interacts with our body and brain and the psychology of addiction has had a huge impact on my perception of smoking and the thought of having a smoke disgusts me , year smoker Day h mark as a nonsmoker quitsure and probably some overshare ,0

2945,Hello there I have been trying to quit smoking for the last months but I relapse at the third day on almost every attempt due to stomach problems as along with extreme physical discomfort What side effect I had been going through Bloating Vomiting Extreme stomach pain Dizziness Heart palpations I imagine this is happening because my body has became extremely dependent to nicotine I don t know what to do I don t want to nicotine patches gums or any other physically coping solutions I really am reluctant to see a doctor about this I just feel like I should be able to quit without having this much of a physical side effect apart from having cravings which I can deal with I would appreciate some advice from OG ex non smokers in this subreddit Note I eat a lot of fiber to regulate my stomach problems but they don t seem to help a lot Thanks for taking time to read my post and considering providing an answer Great community Cheers ,Awful stomach problems ,0

2949,I still have friends that smoke and from time to time I might get a craving for a split second when I light up But once those split second cravings I remind myself that I don t smoke and that the smell is so gross Nor will it make me feel better I also quit for a reason Despite that the social aspect might have been what I enjoyed most about when I smoked by the end of the day it s an addiction And you ALWAYS here lifelong smokers talking about how they wish they could quit and tell me congrats or good for you This might sound a redundant but I ve never met someone that still smokes who goes you quit smoking that s lame nor do they interrogate me about why I quit Addictions of any kind suck and you gotta realize you successfully did something many smokers and addicts failed to do If I had a dollar for every time my friends said they wanna quit or need to quit I d be super rich And I m not judging them That just goes to show how addictive smoking is and how hard it is to break Going back to that and having just one would restart the process ,Why you shouldn t envy smokers,0
2950, pack a day smoker for years M Before that didnt smoke much at all Got addicted quick due to depression weeks in each week my lungs improve and breathing is becoming easier its so great However First my eyes always feel as if there is pressure on them and I noticed an increase in floaters Which sucks My eyes hurt the start of the second week of quitting smoking cold turkey Anyone have this and what did you do for it I m going to guess its related to my sinuses going nuts Second the nightmares I have been having nightmares every night I never used to remember dreams but each day I wake up with a nightmare and it takes me an hour to feel better because they are so vivid and upsetting weeks in and still recovering my body withdraw and breathing I had no clue quitting would take such a toll on my body Thanks for any recommendations ,Two odd symptoms after quitting did you have these ,0
2951,I have been looking for different ways to frame the discomfort I feel while quitting This discomfort has been called withdraws but I don t like that because it s focus is on not smoking and relief from cigarettes Instead I offer this When we drink we can reasonably expect to wake up to a hangover A hangover isn t withdraws from drinking rather it s the consequence of drinking We might even swear off drinking ever again because of the pressure and pounding in our heads the body aches etc While a hair of the dog that bit you might level you out a little you know that the only way to avoid hangovers is to not drink again I think the same about discomfort after quitting this is a cigarette hangover Every craving between cigarettes is a hangover A puff might level me out But the only way to never have this hangover again is to not smoke I hope this might help someone when they re arguing with their own reasoning during a quit,Framing the Discomfort,0
2952,The last days I did nothing but try to quit smoking For years Ive been trying to quit Everytime I would fail after around minutes I tried everything The gum electronic cigarettes patches whatever it just doesnt work The past two days I spent listenting to allen carrs book listenting through it then buying the online course Still no hope I think I am going mwntally insane I FUCKING HATE SMOKING The smell the taste the toxins coming into my body and brain I HATE IT SO MUCH Yet I cant stop Ive listened to allen carr and I agree with every point Yes smoking does nothing for you All it does is remove withdrawals it created in the first place All the illusions fake pleasures relaxation and such I have seen through Yet I cant stop I hate it I hate it so much I am a fucking slave towards the cigarettes I just cant take it anymore Pleaae help me,Guys I need help I am at my Wills end,0

2956,Me and my BF have been dating for five years and I ve always said that smoking cigs was an absolute deal breaker for me I just hate every aspect of it and I don t want my partner smoking I was very up front to him about my feelings towards it from day one He always agreed and said he thinks it s nasty and I thought we were on the same page Fast forward a few years and he starts hitting all of our friends vapes Which I feel like isn t as bad as cigs as far as the smell but obviously the addiction is still there and harmful I asked him to quit a bunch of times because I was worried about his health and after like a year and a half he finally quits I think Turns out he just switched to cigs And he was hiding it from me for about a month I smelled it on him one day and kind of put the pieces together I confronted him about it and he apologized profusely but at the same time he kind of didn t want to stop smoking cigs I was just very hurt that he lied to me and hid this very big thing thing from me as well We got in a huge argument that lasted hours over the course of a few days and I basically told him for the millionth time that I can t date someone who smokes cigs and that it s a deal breaker But for some reason that hurt him because he felt like we were bigger then that being an issue and told me I was only conditionally loving him I don t feel like i m in the wrong at all because my position on it has never changed and will never change and Ive always made it SO clear to him But he feels like I only love him on the condition he doesn t smoke and now he feels like the way i view the relationship is different then the way he does In the end of the argument I basically said that I obviously love him more than I care about the Cigs but I need him to quit and I just couldn t stay together if he doesn t He told me this was kind of a good thing because he s been wanting to quit anyways and this will just push him to But it s been a few weeks since then and now it s starting to feel like he is resenting me a bit He tells me about his grandpa that smoked until he was and never had any health issues My bf got these alt cigs with no tobacco just to help with the craving for the act of smoking and I asked him how it s going and he just says it s shitty and he feels like he wasn t ready to quit Now I think he just views me as controlling even though he lied to me and went out of his way to hide this thing because he knew how i felt about it and now he s acting hurt that he s not an exception to the rule I feel like he is trying to quit but I do worry he still smoking but just doing a better job of hiding it It feels harder to trust him i m general now I do really love him and I don t want this to break us up but I just feels really lost and don t know what to do ,bf started smoking even though it s a deal breaker for me,0
2957,Although to be honest I m not sure if these attempts even really count as quitting Every time I decide that I m not going to buy a pack or I feel disgusting and throw out my current one I can t make it past a few days or a week or so I just cant focus and get super depressed and anxious and disconnected in addition to what is normal At this point I feel like I m unable to justify this decline when I have so much other stuff I need to focus on right now I don t see how I could put up with this for weeks or months or if some people are to be believed the rest of my life to some extent when my mind is already in bad shape I cant afford therapy but I can buy cigarettes,I have probably failed times now ,0

2963,Hey everyone I m at day quitting smoking I broke the rest of my pack days ago but then smoked partial cigarettes without the filter and probably had less than full ones for days Today is the second full day without smoking aside from a bit of a butt I smoked yesterday It s hard After the rd night because it was so hard I felt a bit of relief for a moment in the morning and it was like I remembered that it is possible to feel joy without smoking but then it went away and its back to being difficult With smoking its like you feel as though you can only feel joy from smoking and everything else is better when smoking but the sobering reality is that everything else is just passing the time and the only feeling of joy is from smoking when addicted I know I have experienced joy in the past without smoking but when going through cravings its like you forget or just can t even imagine feeling it anymore without However because of that morning on the third day when gandalf appeared with the sunrise at the east jk nerdy joke I know I can feel joy without smoking and that the reality is every little thing will start to bring joy but its still hard to imagine when going through serious cravings I guess writing this just helps because I know even something like smelling fresh air in a forest would be x more enjoyable when not addicted or even something dumb like macaroni on the stove and other things like sex even without a partner which just feels like releasing an urge when addicted to smoking and playing games and getting a good item which when smoking is just like well now I ll reward myself with a cigarette because the reality is any sense of joy arguably a false sense and reward relies on smoking when addicted Anyways I was writing the post for help at first because I needed help because I lost that rd morning feeling and was struggling to imagine joy without smoking leading me to consider smoking again but logically I know on some level it will get better and the only thing I can do is keep going with no real concept of when I ll actually feel joy again Also coffee is arguably not helpful its more of a high than a down like smoking and when really high you just want something to bring you down even more but the habit of drinking it seems to help a bit I ve been trying to have tea more than coffee because just the habit of a hot bitter drink is nice I feel like without sugar its actually more enjoyable because the sugar just feels like a poor smoking substitute Also having essential oils in a diffuser seems to help a bit along with the smell it also makes the air more humid causing you to sweat out more nicotine I ve also been running every day other day I feel like the more I do to get through smoking the harder it is but I also know its partially because everything I ve been doing is making me get rid of the nicotine faster causing stronger cravings Now I m just ranting though If you re struggling just know you can experience joy without smoking even though its almost impossible to imagine when going through strong cravings If you ve had a brief moment of joy without then just hold on to that feeling The reality is I haven t truly experienced joy in over years from smoking drugs and I know it could be years until I really experience it again but it has to be better than this I m honestly not usually this depressed which makes you think well I laugh and what not when smoking but the reality is aside from those brief moments with family friends you re not fully experiencing joy because those hours and hours between those moments you could be enjoying yourself rather than passing the time and numbing your body just to feel rewarded from dumb things you do when you can just feel rewarded by the actually thing in itself instead of relying on a cigarette Thanks for listening ,Joy without smoking,0

2976,Some benefits I got after I stopped smoking My throat doesn t hurt anymore One of the best benefits My throat was always irritated and dry and in pain I was addicted to cigarettes but my throat was miserable I cough less Didn t cough a lot before but it s still better Just generally breathe so much better And the smells become stronger I am generally out of shape so I do run out of breath easily but this improved so much after I stopped smoking Now I feel like I m actually a little out of breath and not dying Might be unrelated and TMI but I have better bowel movements Just feel better not being tied to smoking I am really happy I quit smoking Tips You need a strong motive and you need discipline I thought I had a strong motive so I was baffled that I wasn t quitting already Then kind of had a fit over the fact that I keep smoking and just quit I was very frustrated that I couldn t quit It helped You don t have to set a date if it s not your thing You can if you feel like it helps and I encourage you to but you can also just say fuck it at am on a Tuesday and it s going to work Keep your hands and mouth busy whenever you feel like you want a cigarette I wouldn t recommend chips or such Maybe gum or mints or candy that you can suck on And allow yourself to eat what you want to a certain degree Remember it s very hard to diet and quit smoking so most specialists advise against it You can return to the diet once the cravings stop and smoking is less of a problem Not gonna lie to you the first three days are tough You can t focus you want to smoke etc The good thing is that you are stronger than your desire to smoke It s one day You can power through one day And if you can power through that day you can power through all the rest of them Only if you feel prepared As soon as you re out of the crazy cravings period you can try to expose yourself to triggers drink coffee drink alcohol hang around with friends who smoke In this way over time they will not present as triggers or at least they won t be such big triggers It s also fine if you avoid these triggers Whatever keeps you smoke free If you fail try again Keep this as a goal Most ex smokers failed at least once Quitting is hard but it is doable It doesn t matter if you manage to do it the first time or the seventh time or whatever As long as you manage to quit it s worth it Do not tell people you quit unless you have to Some people can be assholes when you re trying to quit and the things they say will not always be helpful You just mind your journey and ignore those who talk big but don t appreciate or respect hard work If you need professional help seek it Smoking is as much of an addiction as any other addiction It s okay to need help ,Celebrate my month smoke free anniversary on September Here s why you should try giving up smoking and what worked for me ,0

3034,hi guys i m new to this sub i m hoping to get some help through this so i started vaping december of i was to fit in with my new friend group they didn t force me in any way i just really wanted to be accepted by them i didn t even like it at first it made me uncontrollably sweaty and anxious however at some point it escalated to the point where it became an addiction and i knew it i used juul of course HAHAH and these days it s about pod a day it s even gotten to the point where if i m extra stressed i can go through pods a day for reference pod is equivalent to a pack of cigarettes in the level of nicotine and it takes on average puffs to finish a pod i want to be healthy i want my lungs to feel better i am lucky enough to be only and not be legally allowed to buy vape stuff it does help with not buying it when i have a strong urge i have gum and it helps so much but for some reason i get into this cycle of thinking i just wanna get withdrawal over with so i stop chewing the gum and then i get so desperate i start vaping again it s a vicious cycle my dad buys me the vape stuff horrible i know but he has been a food addict for his entire life and he s almost he can t seem to do it and my mom says that he most likely doesn t think others can get through addiction since he hasn t been able to i know i m strong enough i have summoned up so much willpower in many situations in my life so i know i can get through it i just don t prepare enough also just to be clear the only person in my life who believes i can do it is my mom she has been a huge help but my point of bringing this up is to say that i have no other support for this as i said above my dad is no help and my only friend right now smokes daily she also doesn t seem to believe i can do it but she s seen me fail many a times so it s fair i guess i just need help adding more coping mechanisms in my life to help me quit and advice for taking preventative measures for when i do get strong cravings tl dr other than gum patches what are some ways that help ed you quit smoking such as rewards apps programs etc ,quitting vaping after years any advice ,0

3039,Hey guys Today is the day I m gonna give up this nefarious habit I had already tired to stop in the past but I wasn t really serious about it This time is different for many reasons I joined a local support group run by NHS professionals and attended their first gathering yesterday Actually the reason I m writing this is because they adviced us to keep a diary and share it with other people who are going through the same I guess it might be useful to find some support outside the group as well so here we go I started smoking when I was mainly because I was depressed and lonely But the very real reason I think was just to piss off my obnoxious manipulative father who had always used guilt and shame to control me I knew I wasn t acting smart but somehow I felt like I had and I wanted to do it That first ever pack I bought was like a reminder that nothing but me is in charge of my own actions and can decide how to live my own life Yeah it s pretty dumb but somehow it made sense to me But it s not something I want to do for the rest of my life Except I really like smoking I like how it makes me feel the bitter taste of tobacco and the smell it leaves on my fingers when I smoke It s just not worth it I know but still I m not really incline to conscious decisions when I want something Today I trashed the last pack I had my lighter and ashtray as well I don t want to risk to fall again for them just because of my impulsive temper What did you do to ease the process and motivate you I see that many people here use apps to track for how long they didn t smoke but I don t think they ll work for me I m very curious to hear from your experiences if you want to share them ,The journey begins LOL I ve never been good at writing titles ,0
3040,I had posted earlier and had asked questions about quitting smoking and what happens so I decided to cold turkey smoking Mohamed and weed I only take edibles now but my body aches can I tell you not even my legs more of your chest and a little of my lungs and I ve been getting headaches And all these symptoms look so bad in public especially with COVID mimicking the same symptoms I am finally on my first official week of no smoking And also Good luck to anyone that is quitting right now You aren t alone ,Hello again ,0

3042,I m going into my rd day tomorrow of no nicotine I m really nervous because I have to quit smoking for surgery and I m attending a concert this weekend I would like to be able to casually drink but I also don t know drinking without smoking so I don t know how good of an idea that is I can t back out of the concert because I would leave my friend stranded and I also paid a lot of money to go to this I m just really worried because it s an overnight camping situation and I d like to be able to enjoy myself but not put myself in a situation that would jeopardize my surgery or ruin the progress I ve made on quitting This is the longest I ve gone without smoking in years so I don t know what to expect next Should I just be sober at the concert ,Day Approaching Anxious,0

3045,Yeah I have cravings pretty strong from time to time but cravings doesn t matter because I made a decision that smoking is no more I run everyday because doctors say it helps to get some good emotions and get rid of addiction At evenings I play videogames to relax sometimes I also drink red wine Yes I know that many smokers associate alcohol with cigarettes But anyone who has smoked for over ten years associates everything with cigarettes So I don t see a problem in drinking glass or two Have a great day guys ,Day without smoking feeling good,0

3048,I keep getting up to pace I don t really know what to do with myself I keep thinking about cigarettes and nicotine gum I do have things I can do but I keep mindlessly getting out of my desk chair to walk to where we used to keep the nicotine gum I m so excited the physical withdrawals are gone but it s so distracting to try and focus on my work because that s when I d chew it most Can t chew regular gum because that just makes it worse So glad none of it is in the house or I d be chewing or smoking nicotine without a second thought I made a post about how hard it was around day and I m just so glad I made it here because it s more manageable than I could ever imagine and it gets easier everyday I even abstained from smoking during a very stressful and depressing event Which I m surprised at myself because normally I use that as an excuse to cave ,Day and I m feeling restless ,0
3049,Just finishing up day two without cigarettes and it s going really well this time as I m using patches no cravings yet just brain constantly suggesting cigarettes as they are completely ingrained in my life I have been wondering as the course of patches is meant to last for weeks and you re getting a constant stream of nicotine the whole time what should I be expecting after that point It would seem most recommendations are that you get down to the lowest patch and stick with that for two weeks What then Just full on stop For any of you who have tried NRT what approach did you take after the X week mark ,What happens after weeks NRT ,0
3050,This is not a strict plan at all I used to have really bad panick attacks which withdrawals would trigger and part of me quitting included getting into a better situation in my case housed and weeding out toxic people working on my boundaries etc and learning grounding excersizes self care cutting down on caffeine getting support emotionally from friends and other places and things to manage my anxiety I believe the fact that I have a lot of trauma and anxiety is what made my old quit attempts so much harder and I ve basically learned that it s really important to be kind to myself Before March I d attempted to quit many times cold turkey In March of when I became housed someone I live with has breathing problems so I took care to walk away from the house to smoke and I tried vape but it was too complex and then I found vuse ecigs That worked and it wasn t super cloudy so it wouldn t bother anyone since I was on the opposite end of the house in a room added on later that didn t have vents leading into the house So March I quit cigs and switched to vuse ecig pods It was a pretty easy switch if I m being honest and now cigarettes make me sick The physical benefits were pretty noticable my breathing cleared up my stomach issues cleared up I liked not having a cigarette smell or having to go out of my way to go outside I liked being able to puff every few minutes instead of smoke a whole cig every hours Vaping the ecig in bed is nice I have attempted to quit cold turkey several times since then and it doesn t work So I have introduced nicorette nic gum partly because it s possible to get it delivered since it s not marketed as a tobacco nicotine product but as a quitting aid although if the kids start abusing it it ll probably be unavailable too Please don t people like me really need this stuff c Fast forward I m now using nic gum every couple months It s a slower process than it was switching from cigarettes because it s not about someone else s health anymore it s about my own personal mental health and it s basically me becoming slowly more calm and steady in my day to day life I do feel that way more often but one major thing is now holding me back and that s the fact that I work a lot and the type of work I do is mentally exhausting and takes a lot of cognitive energy So now I m working on finding less taxing work I can do to cover my basic needs and so far that is starting to work out very slowly And I m cycling between pods and gum every couple of months The gums works at keeping the hard withdrawals at bay but it doesn t help when I really really need to concentrate hard and softening that edge isn t enough I expect to quit completely by next March but I m not pressuring myself I am at a point where I m just tired of nicotine I mentally don t want it anymore just my body does So I expect when the mental load is off I ll be fine to move to gum full time and then eventually cycle between nic gum and regular gum So far at this stage regular gum actually helps a lot with the fidgety oral urge It s not near as strong as it used to be So to wrap up March traded cigs for vuse alto ecig April Mayish started using nic gum sometimes March loose goal for quitting Overall it s been a combination of changing my life basically doing a lot of self therapy and paving a path where it s possible for me to quit I think it s interesting that in trying to quit nic I ve had to really take all this other stuff into account and that as I work on my life and myself emotionally I m also working on quitting long term It s also nice to be able to call myself a former smoker and to say that I quit cigarettes after so many failed attempts ,My quitting journey so far since March long ,0
3051,I am on day no nicotine and I ve been running for about months now Started at the bottom earlier this year in late June at the most out of shape I think I ve ever been I saw really really slow progress but I knew I had dug myself a deep hole I quit smoking days ago and already the difference in lung power is night and day weeks ago I ran miles under minutes at pace for the first time Today I ran miles at pace and felt like I had more in the tank I knew smoking obviously made running harder but man I didn t expect such immediate results,I ran miles for the first time in years ,0

3053,Hey everyone I m a bit more than weeks cigarette free and the anxiety episodes and panic attacks happen every day now and more than once a day That translates with tingling in arms and legs pain in the chest shoulders neck and back and feeling faint I m just curious for those who suffered from that after they stopped how were are you dealing with it and how long did it last It started for the first time a bit more than a week ago and has been happening daily since last thursday even forcing me to call an ambulance days ago because the sensation was really strong and had me worried which obviously increased the effects ,How did you deal with anxiety and panic attacks ,0
3054,I have been smoking regularly since march this year I never smoked excessive amounts or anything just when im out with friends Currently im also having the urge to smoke alone which I never had before I feel like Im stumbling into an early addiction and want to stop before it gets too hard to do so I wanted to ask y all if its better to make some sort of deal with myself as an example only smoke a pack a month or or if its better to just completely stop smoking altogether I just wanted to ask people who have been in this situation before Thanks I personally don t think i need to stop smoking completely but if y all say its better I ll probably do so Thanks in advance ,How do I stop smoking regularly ,0
3055,Anyone else relate to this I just cleared day using NRT the longest I ve ever managed and I have this odd feeling that I m just waiting for something I realised it s the feeling I would have when I was waiting till I could have a cigarette again like after a flight or an appointment It s not a craving but like my brain is just saying come on then when are we getting that dopamine hit from smoking It s almost like nostalgia or homesickness A feeling of being incomplete Is this just part of cravings ,Incessant feeling of waiting ,0
3056,I ve been smoking heavily for past years but i finally decided to cut it out of my life I smoked Marlboro reds probably pack a day somedays more for as long as I can remember I ve decided to quit for my health and my loved ones I had cigarettes left yesterday and after I was done with it I told myself I ll not buy another pack of cigarettes I m not the type to ask a strangers for a cigarettes so I figured it s the first step to quit smoking But the craving kicked in couple hours later and I ended up buying flum vape I know it still contains nicotine Would it be better to buy those nicotine gum patches or just use vape when cravings kick in hard I know people who have cut fown cigarettes gradually instead of clld turkey but I really dont want to go back to smoking again but cravings come in so hard ,Day ,0
3057,This may not be relevant to everyone here but one of the biggest stresses I had when I was a smoker was the pressure to hide it from certain people Like I d always smoke around friends coworkers etc But when I was around family members or dates that would find it to be a dealbreaker I was a non smoker Any time I was near family I either waited to smoke and sometimes I would stress about being eager to leave them so I could have a cigarette Sure I was legally old enough to smoke but my Dad would have threw a giant fit considering my grandma his mom and uncle his brother both died from lung cancer and emphysema at and My grandma died right in front of him before I was born so I never got to meet her And my uncle died as my Dad was heading down to visit him When my uncle died in I was not a smoker and that should have been my sign to never start again except I did and smoked for about years until I finally quit There were times I d sneak out to have a cigarette only to get paranoid about smelling like it and being caught when my family was in town That s the insanity of addiction There were other times I would go on a date with someone who had in their profile non smoker no smokers cigs or don t go out with me if you smoke cigarettes I just wouldn t smoke around them or make sure I didn t smell like cigarettes before the date That was an added stress in itself Even times when I d go to the dentist the dentist could tell I smoked due to stains on my teeth So it goes to show that smoking does all sorts of damage than just lungs Anyways once I quit it took a huge weight off my shoulders in many different ways but a big one being that I don t gotta worry about hiding it anymore as I don t do it I ve just come to the conclusion that if you have to hide a habit from someone then it probably isn t good for you ,You can only hide your habit for so long,0
3058,So I was a fairly heavy smoker for a decade about a pack and a half at the worst of it Quit ten years ago and became a really occasional smoker for several years with the help of nicotine gum and later lozenges About years ago I swore off even an occasional smoke and went full time on the lozenges Here I am all this time later still on the lozenges but finally decided to wean myself down and quit Bought some Altoids which turn out to be a decent placebo Haven t craved nicotine since I bought these There is a chance that I am not actually addicted at all except for a psychological craving for the peppermint Perhaps I haven t really been really physically addicted in years ,Nicotine lozenge habit about to end,0
3059,I ve wanted this gender affirming surgery for years I don t know why I can t seem to understand that I can t just quit tomorrow I ve been at I ll quit tomorrow for weeks now Smoking won t prevent me from getting surgery but I ll be much more likely to heal wrong and have unnecessary scarring I m terrified I ve quit drinking and drugs for years not a single slip up but somehow cigarettes are the hardest to quit ,I have surgery next month and I can t cut back any advice and support would be greatly appreciated,0
3060,I have shared my story before but here is a short recap for context I had been smoking since the age of going to smoke cigarettes per day It was part of my identity or at least that is what I thought and I didn t want to quit strong enough I was active regardless that no drugs frequent exercise and a vegetarian so I felt overall healthy Except I wasn t For a completely different reason not seemingly lung related I was advised to have a chest CT and there it was Emphysema at the age of COPD the disease I though only oLd PeOplE had My doctor told me plain and simple either you quit now and take care of yourself or you walk around with an o tank by the age of I woke up and quit immediately And now I hate myself less for ruining my body and making unrepairable but I am doing my best and being asymptomatic most frequently I also hate smokers in public spaces I used to be them and it s just karma biting me in the ass sitting and having people smoking in my face I know I can t complaint I was them and though I was so cool when I was just making my self weak and poor It has been a year and all I want to say is thank you to this community for your support To others who inspired me to just keep going and never look back I wanted to share this small personal victory here and maybe help one or two people who have doubts or fears And to those of you who think you cannot quit I want to say you can You deserve better than what smoking does to you to your body and your pocket It is not easy but it can be done I promise And though it may feel like shit for some time it is worth it Thank you again for the support ,After being diagnosed with COPD last year at I am now year smoke free ,0
3061,Hi everyone I m trying to stop smoking and i was thinking that I don t know much people who are successful in life AND smoker For exemple in my family My mother and one uncle are both smokers they are both depressed and unsuccessful in life my mother doesn t work and my uncle works has a really bad situation They are both a little bit fat and never exercise My other uncle and aunt who both don t smoke are quite successful in life Uncle is business owner and started investing in real estate My aunt has a master degree and a job she likes good situation living in Paris and visiting many countries during the year They both love to run and participate to some marathons I thought smoking was just a consequence but I m thinking more and more that it s the cause What do you think ,Being successful and a smoker,0
3062,I m at a little over a year and a half year months days and I feel pretty good about it The smell of cigarettes makes me kinda sick now and at this point I feel like I could go forever My big struggle is now that I ve pulled myself from this vice and its influence I can more easily see what I have allowed myself to do because of it My partner doesn t smoke but they do vape a very high nicotine content vape fluid at a very rapid rate Adjusting for the nicotine content it s well over a pack a day if it were cigarettes I bought them their first pack of actual cigarettes I was the one who changed their mind from those are gross to I think I might have one of those as well and I did the same to our best friend in high school a friend who is still very important to me and it hurts to see how heavily that friend chain smokes She s still in her s and sounds like Marge Simpson s twin sisters I wish that I could help them towards quitting the same way that I helped them towards addiction but it isn t as simple even when I ve had my own success quitting to lead by example I would give anything to have never done that to either of them Anything at all If you re reading this and you haven t quit yet please quit Your example leads you to do more harm than just the damage that your smoking does to yourself ,Year amp A Half Some Thoughts on Guilt,0
3063,I ve been smoke free now for months woohoo And been drinking going out with pals for a lot of that and not really had many cravings Couple of times at the beginning I vaped a little but it mostly made me feel sick Although recently over the past few weeks when I ve been going out and drinking I ve been having more and more cravings to smoke It s been so much harder than before I m not sure why but all of a sudden the thought of a cigarette is the only thing in the world that I want I have yet to give into the craving but curious why it is happening now and if anyone else has experience this , months smoke free feeling craving now when out,0
3064,So I m approaching full days without a cigarette and my cravings are pretty intense at the moment and I m finding it hard to fight I also feel a bit stupid because I ve been unable to throw away my last little bit of tobacco In part I feel like I wasn t truly ready to quit is anyone I had basically been using a vape alongside cigarettes to cut down but started having heart palpitations which I m sure was from the vape high nicotine intake so I decided to stop everything together I came from smoking cigarettes a day beforehand so pretty light use and my mind is now telling me that number of cigarettes isn t that bad why not go back to smoking them you felt better then Yesterday was the same my first full day working I work from home as well and I m very used to taking cigarette breaks throughout the day I think that s what I m struggling with most not doing that same routine I ve don t for years My concentration on work has been awful and yesterday was not productive at all Any tips inspiration ,Day INTENSE cravings,0
3065,Hey there Been a smoker for years I ve been trying to quit for a couple of years now My longest streak was days cold turkey However the cravings were just too strong for me so i decided to use NRT I bought Nicorette Gum MG and i was able to quit for days on my first try But the cravings increased tremendously on the third and fourth day and unfortunately i relapsed My question is why am i getting these cravings if i m using NRT As far as i know nicotine is the reason cigarettes are addictive and the lack of nicotine is what causes cravings Thanks in advance,Trying To Understand Cravings,0
3066,I was years old and I was on a plane with my father The flight duration was only hours Very short flight right But not for my father who was a heavy smoker I guess he was feeling really bad without his fix because he went to a toilet and tried to smoke there Do you think it s okey Have you ever tried to smoke in plane My father returned to his seating place accompanied by a steward He tried to make excuses He said it was all just a misunderstanding But of course no one would believe it Now this whole situation seems funny to me but I think then I felt ashamed Pimply teens rarely have overconfidence you know A year later I became a smoker myself While I was a student it didn t bring me that much inconvenience but when I started working something changed At one of the jobs I had to sit in my place for hours without a single break It s not very pleasant even for a non smoker but for a smoker it s just torture I m sure you know how bad it feels when you want to smoke desperately but you can t Approximately once an hour you could go to the toilet for minutes Sometimes I was desperate enough to take one or two puffs in that time Do you think it helped Yes but not for long The funny thing is I was not the only smoker in this office Lots of girls and guys suffered as much as I did What a twisted sick world hah Why people so stupid Why am I so stupid I would be very glad to hear what shitty situations you have experienced because of smoking And have a great day without smoking lol ,What shitty situations you have experienced because of smoking ,0
3067,Hi everyone so long story short I have been a smoker since I was about years and I m now almost Last Friday I had a party and smoked a disgusting amount of cigs happens when I drink unfortunately I woke up the next day with a sore throat and on Sunday my whole mouth throat were hurting and it felt like an overall infection So I ve been resting and I did have a few cigs yesterday but I want to quit because I feel so disgusted by this mouth situation and would really love to become as a non smoker I would also like to have a first child in the near future so all signs are here that I should just quit already I want too and will havent smoked today yet but I was wondering if there are any other success stories of people who abruptly quit For example I didn t really have a last cig moment or anything my package is still here et cetera Should I first do that today and then quit or just go along with not smoking and try this way Let me know ,Abruptly quit smoking,0

3069,Dear nicotine Today I vow to completely let go of you When I was stressed you calmed my emotions so i thought when I was tired you woke me up so I thought when I was sad you eased the pain so I thought What you really did was cause emotional and spiritual harm to my life You distracted my thoughts my reality my goals and my motivation You took me out of the moment every single time I hit you You brought disomfort when it was warm outside You gave me a negative self image due to the thousands of times I ve told myself I need to quit When I was watching a movie you took me out of the moment barely allowing me to finish When I was working you hurt my ability to be the best of the best When I wanted to love someone you drowned my emotions not allowing me to display my love fully You hurt me worse than any ex girlfriend ever has You have distracted me to the point of no return Now I let go of you and you are gone like the wind out of my life I only held onto you for months but it was a severely toxic relationship They say to be aware of your relationships and nicotine you are the worst of the worst You are blocked from my life You are not allowed to call text or ring me anymore I will not be answering It will take me about days to get over the tiredness without you just like any other relationship But after that I know I will see growth like I have been craving and like I was before I knew you You nicotine were part of my journey but now you no longer serve me ,Dear Nicotine ,0
3070,I m about months quit and I wanted to share the biggest thing that helped me quit Initially it was a health scare and I stopped dead in my tracks smoking I didn t have a goodbye cigarette or anything I just stopped and I wouldn t let my mind even entertain the thought of another cigarette I was done So although a cigarette would have cured my depression and anxiety caused by quitting smoking wasn t an option so I started working on fixing those things with medication exercise and behavioral therapy I know it s easier said than done but I still wanted to share Mindset is everything If you half ass it and even think you might fail you re not gonna have a good time ,My tip don t let failing be an option ,0

3080,Quick backstory I started smoking about years ago after I left school and got a job at McDonald s Basically all of my coworkers smoked and I got offers all the time I didn t do it until I just thought fuck it I ll try it once That was a mistake as I ended up enjoying the headrush and starting bumming off them Then I bought packs myself and you know the drill Earlier this year I quit after smoking on and off the previous year as the pandemic made me think about my lungs and how it was a waste of money when I was getting my Covid cash from the government I felt happy and I started feeling way more better after I quit A couple days ago I was offered a cigarette by my friend and I thought I may as well just take one as I haven t been addicted to them in ages As soon as I felt that puff come in I felt sick to my stomach To the point where I felt like I was going to vomit I gave it back to friend and told him to finish it Looking back at it now I am happy that I am not addicted anymore and the fact that smoking makes me sick now instead of happy My question is did this ever happen you TLDR Relapsed after about months and I felt sick after my first puff,I quit smoking and after I tried it again I felt sick after the first puff,0

3091,So attempts to go cold Turkey have absolutely failed for me in the past Couldn t get past a day The main reason was that after a few hours my brain was practically screaming at me that I would fail and that what was the whole point of quitting anyway I m surrounded by cigarette butts my room and clothes smell like a pub my teeth are about shades yellower on rare occasions I can taste my breath and it makes me gag my whole family hates it I hate the taste I m developing a smokers cough in my s and I can t buy menthols anymore I hate it yet my brain still loves the death sticks So I ve bought nicotine patches The only time I ve had moderate success with quitting was when I used nicotine gum over lockdown It was hell but I got to months and relapsed almost immediately when public spaces were open again So nicotine patches I did it then and I can do it now My triggers are coffee my bedroom my phone my computer social interaction stress and boredom so not many The plan is stay out of the bedroom Lock all apps except ones I need for work and study I ll give myself one hour with everything unlocked which I m going to devote to sobbing to strangers online I bought a fresh pack of chamomile and I m going to make chamomile ice tea to sip throughout the day I m peeling a few nectarines so I can have something to chew when I get cravings the segments not the peel I ve got a few deep breathing exercises for when I feel like I m going to stab someone Hopefully it works Wish me luck ,Smoking my last,0

3098,I ve quit smoking over years ago June th without one relapse by tapering down the amount of cigarettes and I remember even then reading articles scoffing at the idea of cutting down on cigarettes as a valid method of quitting and honestly it pisses me off I do not get why that is such a scoffed at method of quitting Not all methods work for everyone but it might work for someone and writting that option off for everyone is never a good thing imo Because for some it might be the perfect solution and they might not be able to suceed otherwise I do not get why so many science drug journalists do it Granted its much more complicated than just diminishing the amount of cigarettes you smoke there is an entire method to it that I can get in to if you re interested but it has been known to work for many Any way it has always pissed me off that it s not seen as a really viable or valid option by many and as someone who had sucess in it don t wroite it of as a possible option to quit ,Pet Peeve about Quitting advice,0

3102,Last week I bought a pack of cigarettes after not smoking for years I thought I was done with them for good Every once in a blue moon the idea of one would pop up but it was never strong enough to make me buy any Last week my girlfriend had a conversation and it seems she is questioning the relationship Romantic rejection is my Achilles heal and the only thing I could think of to numb the emotional pain was a cigarette I m probably up to a day I keep thinking I m done then I crave another I m an avid cyclist something I really got into after I quit the last time I can average miles an hour and it makes me feel great Today I went for a ride for the first time this week and rode hard but it was much more of a struggle to keep my normal pace I don t want to fall back into this again The comfort that comes from smoking seems to be the only thing that keeps the emotional pain bearable I had thoughts of running my car off the road after our conversation and I figure smoking is way better than that but I feel like it s a slow form of self harm The relationship is not over things may be okay but the stress is killing me If my girlfriend finds out I started smoking that could very likely end it On the other hand if the relationship ends I m worried I m going to just stop caring and am going to turn into a heavy smoker just to get by No one knows I ve started and I want to stop before anyone finds outs If things end I have no desire to date again for a while I feel like this will be the only thing to distract me Looking for words of encouragement TL DR relationship worries have caused me to start smoking again,Started smoking again after years,0
3103,So I quit smoking cold turkey days ago after and over a pack a day at my worst and lemme just say the first hours had me all sorts of twisted But day and im starting to feel alot better minus getting a lil worried about my heart rate Before I quit my HR resting was normally bpm now it s gone down to like bpm I dont feel dizzy or sick but I am ridiculously tired I force myself to walk or do things to keep my brain and body too busy to relapse Can anyone tell me if this is normal I ve never quit smoking before so I have no idea Also I am not an athlete in any capacity other than walking my two dogs thats about all the exercise I get ,Is a low heart rate common in smoking cessation ,0
3104,I figured I will start with quiting smoking It s been almost a day withouht smokes I use some nicotine gum grams ones it helps but yeah I still want a smoke Is this the right decision Quiting I do smoke alot I make my own cigarettes I honestly can t tell you how many I smoke Between day I need my brain and this is why I smoke I have this book that I wanted to right for a long time I think it s pretty good I have it in my head My body seems to react pretty well to not smoking it heals itself I was coughing all day I think this is good gets the bad stuff out As I am writting this well the need for smoking is almost gone Guess it s an impulse thing But how can you deal with this your entire life Not smoking at all ,Trying to change my life around,0

3106,Just wanted to share what worked for me I used Allen Carr but went about it a different way I had previously read Allen Carr s easy way to quit smoking and while the logic made sense to me I found that I would quickly be back smoking again in situations where I still felt that romantic connection to cigarettes with certain friends after work having some beers which would then quickly lead me back to smoking all the time Then i tried something else I started Vaping obviously thinking that it is the lesser of two evils However as many would know I found vaping actually increased my nicotine intake due to the ease of which you can do it at work inside etc etc After vaping for several months flat out I was starting to get mouth ulcers and not feel great generally I realised something needed to change So I again turned to Allen Carr However this time I got the audiobook of Allen Carrs easy way to quit Vaping Since starting vaping I had broken the social addiction to smoking for example at bars with friends on lunch breaks at work I would vape instead of smoke and without realising it had been several weeks since my last cigarette This was important as it allowed me to see my addiction for what it was a pure nicotine addiction Previous attempts to quit I had convinced myself that it wasn t smoking I was addicted too it was the social aspect of goin out for a dart where your troubles would melt away and the conversation would get more deep and enlightening However without even realising it I had been easily able to break this habit by simply using a different form of nicotine which quickly broke that illusion for me This little change made the Allen Carr method work perfectly because it was suddenly so clear to me that it was actually just nicotine i was addicted too which has no real physical withdrawal symptoms after a few days rather than smoking cigarettes Combined with the fact that I believe vaping to be incredibly lame and if you re a grown adult who thinks the rest of the adults watching you do it don t think you look like a try hard teenager you are very mistaken It made the concept of quitting actually exciting because that theres s nothing you re giving up line finally made sense Anyway I am now ish days completely nicotine free have had more energy saved so much money regained the circulation in my hands and feet and generally have so much more self esteem It may be counter productive to say start another type of nicotine to quit smoking but if you are like me and its the social aspect holding you back it may work for you , days free,0
3107,I was going strong for weeks kicking my a day habit using my vape to taper off nicotine I hit the mg mark and felt a bit angry for days but that was it But after those weeks I smoked again on Tuesday on Friday and tonight My mental health is in the shitter I got gastritis months ago and since then have been agoraphobic and I missed out on the time of my life I was meant to spend the summer on my friend s yacht in Mykonos Now I don t even get invited to my friends get togethers anymore they re like well hes been sick so long we just don t bother NO ONE GIVES A FUCK I was so nauseated at point I couldn t stand for more than minute I couldn t sit in a chair That time has thankfully passed but the nature of gastritis is such that if I enjoy it it s an irritant I should be on bland foods only and water I m close but I still dare to put cheese on my bread I was suicidal to the point of going to buy razor blades but I called a helpline first Since getting slightly better I m less suicidal but I can t stand how weak and anxious I am I have nicotine patches but I m too scared to try them because I don t want any more nausea even though they re ok for use for gastritis I m looking to get lexapro and klonopin for my anxiety but I lament the fact this happened in the first place I m still so young and only drank and smoked for and a half years To get this shit so young is incredibly unfortunate I don t wanna be suffering anymore I just want to be that guy who has a few drinks and enjoys the party Not the guy who cycles through pills to fucking feel functional It s just such a long journey ahead and I can t even focus because I ll go on a walk and then that voice will be like you pussy you can t even go m from your house ughhhhhh I m so frustrated If you guys have any experience with the patch please share I need the course to make the next leap ,I relapsed expletive warning ,0

3115,Good morning all I am now two weeks into my life as a non smoker and it s fantastic I made my introductory post here https www reddit com r stopsmoking comments p mbpk advice and encouragement needed and my one week update here https www reddit com r stopsmoking comments pdwrih one week update Last Sunday when I wrote my one week update the week had flown by and been extremely easy I was stoked at how well I d quit smoking and didn t have a worry in the world that I d ever go back This week was slightly different Certainly it is still true that I won t be smoking again but this week there were a few times in the evening where it just seemed like it was something I was supposed to be doing I went and sat outside in my chair out of habit I was aware that I wouldn t be smoking but I am still not used to the idea that I don t have to stand up out of my chair every minutes There was one instance where I was contemplating getting my car keys and driving to the gas station but I reminded myself that I didn t want to be a smoker again and within two minutes that settled No big deal but I showed signs of a crack there On Friday I went to a buddy s place for a bbq and a lot of beer He was smoking constantly as he does and me Well not only did I not have a cigarette ask for one or ask for a drag I didn t even want one It was completely out of the question I was not only capable of sitting there drinking without having one but I now know that I can be in its presence and not be shaken It was wonderful I can completely trust myself to never smoke again it seems The worst was when my buddy forgot to get more smokes when he got the steaks He had to go make a separate trip for more smokes after getting the food It reminded my of that feeling that panic about not having enough I didn t envy that in the slightest I am so glad to be done that And I still have no doubts that my last cigarette ever was weeks ago at pm As mentioned in my update I have saved my smoking money and put it into an index fund I am now actively calling that my Ferrari fund It s at just over now in two weeks and should be enough to get me a Ferrari in years It might be a used one or I ll wait longer That s gonna be a cool present to myself for quitting Looking at the smoke free app all the health improvements are listed and noticeable My teeth are whiter breathing has improved a lot and energy is way up In last week s post I mentioned that my energy was through the roof to the point that I had to add runs and walks to my general workouts That is still true but either I m more used to it or it s stabilized there s no way to be sure of which but I m happy with it It s a huge life improvement The most shocking number on that app to me isn t my days of life regained just by not smoking for days Nor is it that I d have smoked cigarettes in that amount of time it s the time spent not smoking number How the hell would I have spent hours smoking The calculation makes sense at five minutes per smoke but holy smokes is that a waste of time life Over an entire day out of my two weeks was used on smoking And that isn t adjusted for sleeping time or anything that s just hours gone So in the life regained section it really should include that Smoking isn t life it s an annoying curse that subtly takes over every aspect of your day And takes full days from you very quickly So all this being said I am two weeks smoke free and I am yet to find a single downside Cigarettes do nothing but kill I went from smoking per day to zero with ease and I really hope more and more people make this decision I want everyone to experience life as a non smoker If I can do it even for two weeks so can you amp x B I ll be doing another update next Sunday when I am smoke free for three weeks I think I m going to keep these posts coming for at least three months Thanks for participating in my journey ,Two Week Update,0
3116,I posted the other day that I had made it through my first twenty four hours I am now into the fourth day So seventy two hours and counting Something that I ve noticed and been struggling with is boredom I used to go out on my patio with a cup of coffee and sit and listen to a podcast like every morning I would go out throughout the day and have a smoke in between doing chores around the house or whatever Now I don t have that There s nothing to break up the day so to speak It s hard to explain Has anyone else felt like that Anyways stay strong everyone We can do this ,Into day four ,0
3117,I quit again days ago I posted a few months ago about my fear of smoking when on holidays Turned out I did smoke more than ever before When I got back home I was disappointed and didn t really even want to try to quit again But my boyfried caught a cold and couldn t smoke for a few days and then took this as a good opportunity to quit again I really didn t want to and we even fought about me not seeing the point of even trying anymore In the end I agreed to it and now it s been days and I kind of start to be a little more optimistic about this attempt We even went out for drinks yesterday and even though I really really wanted to smoke and him as well we both didn t I feel kind of proud and as if I got back a little bit more control about the situation However I am still annoyed because the cravings can be overwhelming and in those moments my thoughts get extremely irrational and I really expect to fail again and then this would all be for nothing again ,Dealing with dissapointment and failure,0

3123,Two nights ago I hopefully smoked my last cig and weed I started smoking even though I have severe asthma about a year and a half ago because almost everyone does it here Even though I knew how it was I didn t want to be left out Almost twelve years of not smoking went down the drain After smoking half a pack daily for around a month and a half I had to use my asthma can around times a day and once a night I knew I will give up smoking for good when october starts because I have to go back to college and I want to lose weight spend less money fuck bitches But something bad happened two nights ago which made me realise time doesn t forgive or understand you I was in the bed chillin at am having a wank Suddenly I had to cough I knew I had to get up find my can to get air But I coughed so hard and I felt like I had so little air I started to feel dizzy and I started to panic I was alone no one at home and I felt like even thinking was making me consume air I calmed myself down went to open a window to get some fresh air and thought about what happened I felt trapped in an open cage I got angry with myself like how stupid are you man You have health problems and tons of other stuff you want to experience a lot of things and this is how you want to go down You want to get killed my SMOKING Crush those cigarettes and don t even think about smoking another one That s what I did Yesterday almost late at night I thought about smoking a cig Firstly I said no ABSOLUTELY NO By time I was like yeah man one to see how it is Why I didn t go to the shop was distance as the shop near me closed I am so pathetic I don t know how I can go through this addiction Relapsing thoughts are hard when I want a cig I guess that s how natural selection picks it s people like me ,I felt like a lion trapped in an open cage ,0

3127,There are a lot of situations when you want to smoke desperately but you can t During flights Family dinners Customs inspection at the border In Airports In Subway Etc Ironically I realized that I can no longer smoke when there were no more obstacles between me and smoking I was working remotely and I was permitted to smoke as much as I want And I enjoyed it But only up to some point Then pleasure turned into weariness And this weariness was going stronger every day Finally I got a mental breakdown or something Everything annoyed me that day Evrything seemed ugly and pointless I was totally unable to focus I smoked one cigarette after another but it didn t help Maybe before that I didn t want to quit because I was afraid that my condition will become worse That I will lose some pleasant moments and inspiration But that day I realized I had nothing to lose Except my nicotin chains lol I will be extremely glad to hear your stories ,At what point did you realize that you want to quit ,0

3130,I finally am pulling the trigger again after a long time hit the patch and suckin lollypops for the oral fixation I genuinely think I can do it but I ve hit a roadblock I wasn t expecting Has anybody else experienced severe depression when off smoking I feel like I m at a low I never expected when I normally am fine It really threw me for a loop and I m just wondering if the two are tied together in some way now that I m off the pack a day lifestyle ,Feeling low right after I quit normal ,0
3131,Been about days smoke free and it s not as bad as I thought it would be Days like today when I m beyond stressed and that creeping thought of a cigarette in the back of my mind has become easier to handle I know it s not worth it to go to the store and get some smokes I know I am better than that I am willing to live a life free of the grip cigarettes had on me for years I am not willing to be controlled by them ever again Good luck everyone we got this ,Staying strong,0
3132,Hi everyone So tonight is the night I have finally put out my last cigarette I have had numerous failed quit attempts in the past but things feel different this time This monster has defeated me so many times that I am tired of being beaten down and feeling hopeless I have realised that if I don t quit now I never will There is no such thing as I will quit tomorrow I would rather die before I smoke another cigarette NO PAIN NO GAIN ,I quit today,0
3133,I noticed for me that one of the worst things I can do is be around another smoker when trying to stop I just went days was doing well due to Allen Carr then a coworker came over and I m back to square one Being literally unable financially to get more doesn t always guarantee not smoking I ve overdrawn my account in the past just to buy more What are some health issues you ve noticed resolve the quickest after quitting Are there any issues smoking causes that you re embarrassed to admit I m a guy and will admit when smoking things aren t all they should be but when I quit it s like I m again It s important to remember to not even have one puff I always forget that part ,My trouble success and other observations ,0
3134,So I am not sure how to get rid of my flair but basically I ve had several week quits that ultimately failed Most recently I quit for three whole months without a hiccup wasn t even too hard once I got into it My history has just solidified in my mind the fact that I truly cannot have one more puff So just smoked my last cigarette and here we go again I love making things hard on myself I have a five year old son who doesn t have his mother in his life so I have to make sure I am here for the long run not that I m worried about dying soon but as smokers we have to realize we re rolling the dice every day on lung cancer and heart disease Could be when I m or could be when I m possibly even sooner the way I smoke ,So many failures but also some large successes,0

3137,Hey everyone I just learned about the existence of this subreddit and decided to join as it seems like it would be a lot of support I m proud to say that I haven t smoked in weeks today from pack everyday Well that s not entirely true I had half a cigarette when I was buzzed with alcohol but to my surprise I hated it and couldn t finish It made me really nauseous and the taste made me actually want to throw up so I take that I a good sign for my redemption I feel like I m at the peak of withdrawal side effects with extreme anxiety that led me to the ER yesterday It was a panic attack chest pains extreme dizzinness could barely stand up and couldn t controll my breathing all tests came back normal and the doctors explained to me that it can be a side effect for people who stopped smoking recently and that it can last up to months So it s not fun but it s reassuring On the plus side I have been feeling better I m not doing much exercise but I can already see how apart from the anxiety episodes I am able to control my breathing better I am no longer grasping for air after a simple walk around the bock And not the end goal but I m saving money every plus is good to take Anyway good luck to y all who are also trying to stop I feel like the first few weeks are the hardest and hopefully it ll soon be a thing of the past , weeks with no cigarette ,0

3140,Hi everyone This sub already motivated me to stop smoking few months ago but sadly I got back into a night out with friends after long time not seeing them and I didn t even try to resist I also used to smoke cannabis every night for months but I stopped for a week now I d like to stop cigarette too I know it s going to make me feel better but I m wondering if it s a good choice to do it now I m currently in the tough situation My girlfriend started school in a city hours away from my hometown and I decided to go with her We currently don t have accommodation so we re living in Airbnb week after week This situation is extremely stressful because I have to handle everything about accomodation my girlfriend is a foreigner and doesn t talk my language which is French I have to handle work and I have to handle her she is really sensitive and cause me lots of stress I really felt bad the past days since we moved to her school city for finding a room I almost thought about going back to my hometown and leave her But I m kind of responsible for her I know that I would feel way better if I stopped smoking more energy and less anxiety but I m worried that I would freak out during the time I m trying to stop Is it a good idea to try now or should I wait that my situation get better ,Quitting now good idea ,0
3141,Started smoking or years ago About a month ago I got myself down to cigs a day but I also started vaping low nicotine ejuice to supplement The oral fixation is strong Yesterday was my first full day without a cigarette in years I have bad anxiety and not smoking cig in the morning is affecting my whole day I m so antsy Cleaned my whole house and did some de cluttering and now I don t know what to do with myself There s a smoke liquor store about hundred feet from my porch and every minutes I have to talk myself out of throwing on my shoes and heading over there for a pack What kind of things do you do to motivate yourself to stay away from the cigs I think having some kind of goal aside from the obvious health benefits of not smoking would help but I m not sure what that goal should be Keep stong ya ll I know we can do this I m glad that this forum exists no one else in my life smokes or has had any experience quitting ,Day ,0

3144,I spent months reading these forums thinking about quitting I smoked a ton and then switched to vape with high nicotine and I never took that vape out of my hand I smoked sometimes too but smoking wasn t as strong as the vape so I never quit vaping Did that for about a year Then out of the blue in the middle of the day I decided that was the day so out of nowhere at pm I threw away my vape and cigarettes It wasn t as bad as I was anticipating After day a weird depression came over me and i ended up increasing my antidepressants which happen to be bupropion wellbutrin and that may have helped contribute to my ability to quit Because honestly I never thought I could even with assistance Anyway on Sept it has been one year without nicotine I still think about it frequently Although I crave a cigarette and not the vape I just try to remember that awful feeling of needing to have a cigarette the anticipation of when you ll be able to go have one next or realizing there s only a couple left in your pack or reaching in your pocket and the panic you feel because you must have set your vape down somewhere All of those terrible anxieties that come with smoking are gone and it s totally worth it ,One year nicotine free,0
3145,After successfully quitting for four years I started after having a sort of personal crisis It s again been two years already and I attempted stopping a few times but caved in eventually Every time I feel pretty shitty about myself and sometimes say to myself maybe that s just how it is now But I want to change and was thinking to get some advice from kind internet strangers on how to stick to it The first time around it seemed so easy I just stopped cold turkey and that was it ,Stopped smoking today,0

3147,WARNING you may find this post extremely boring I write it mostly to figure out plan of actions that will help me to deal with boredom while quiting Read at your own risk Everyone who tries to quit smoking has two enemies First one is stress Second one is boredome Right now I can manage stress quite easily because i m on vacation But I m not vacationing in Hawaii or Disneyland I sit at home It means that second enemy boredom gets stronger and stronger everyday Like Sauron he is gathering an army and one day he will unleash all its crushing power on me So what should I do I have made a list of allies who will help me when the moment of the final battle comes Things that will help me to cope with boredom Here they are Writing everyday about my experience of quiting smoking I keeps the brain in good shape and grants support of the community which is very helpful Running I don t like sports but this is war nicht wa Nobody cares about my preferences I must run at least minutes per day yeah it s not much to keep myself in a good mood I m a fan of animals So to entertain myself I can also read and translate articles about lizards octopuses squids and other cool creature And finally cubes I have a dream to have a pet To have a rat if you want me to be more specific Everyone know that rats are fans of mazes So I can make few mazes It s not hard after all I can use paper and glue to make some small cubes than connect them with more glue or duct tape or whatever It would be cool to equip the labyrinths with deadly traps but I m afraid my karma is already too bad ,Coping with boredom running writing lizards paper cubes ,0

3153,Hello forgive the robe I know it s not proper attire for our meetings but I ve just stepped out of the sensory deprivation tank and was offered one I never refuse a robe you see not only is it at the height of bad manners but it is also a great disservice to the self But let s stay on track Remember that business I told you about wrestling my nicotine addicted brain in the senseless darkness of a tank Well I ll tell you all about it if you re interested Have a seat please Well it was a flop Mainly I ll explain All was quite enjoyable at first You enter and check in with a young lady speaking to you in polite hushed tones She asked if I ve ever done this before I responded with a firm no We made our way through the cavernous place evocative of Antelope Canyon in search of my designated room It ll serve to know that I was cranky for I was missing my nicotine and because I stupidly made my appointment for AM We found the room at last A shower was to the right and before me a large white sci fi like pod lit with blue LED strips The lady continued speaking but I didn t pay attention remember my crankiness She finally left and I got right to business I stripped took a shower sat in the pod closed the lid above me and lied down as if ready for my cryogenesis Surprised by how effortlessly I was floating I relaxed Vaguely I recalled the lady mentioning something like a ton of salt being responsible for the density of the water And of course I would go onto splash a bit of it in my eye I climbed out of the thing naked and blinded and vulnerable in search of the towel I spent a good fifteen minutes stuck with the searing pain As I cried and regained my vision I noticed they had provided me with earplugs The lady too had mentioned them but again I hadn t listened it was all coming back to be with a massive delay So I plugged my ears which had already become like a pair of slide whistles and gave it another shot This time I was fully ready to face my addiction in the great void of conciseness Of course I would just go on to fall asleep Nothing truly life changing happened in the pod I didn t face any flaming haired white torsoed orange butted demon as I expected But Yes there is a but it was after being awoken by the gentle Siri like voice coming through the underwater speaker and the subsequent reignition of the LED lights that something happened I got into my robe And just a few minutes before you came in I had an epiphany I know a man like me doesn t seem like the type to get epiphanies But I did Perhaps it was due to the robe and its empowering freedom I realized that my whole difficulty with quitting nicotine had to do with Grief I truly was grieving And I was grieving at RPM Yes I mean Revolutions Per Minute Let s walk Alright I know you know where this is going but bear with me I agree it s a bit of a tired clich to bring up the stages of Grief But I must summon them in order to explain the aforementioned epiphany They go like this denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance Right I went straight to google here in my robe and found a reassuring quantity of articles equating grief and the quitting of smoking I mean it s not hard to believe they might be very closely related After all the brain doesn t have an extensive cocktail menu Insofar as we can tell on the feel good menu we have only but two cocktails dopamine and oxytocin Nevertheless I was relieved to some extent to find that perhaps it wasn t all a fault of my character That I could put some of the burden on this theory of grief What I failed to find however was someone reassuring me that it was normal to find myself in a revolving state of grief Does Elisabeth K bler Ross mention this in her book Have you read it Can you educate me Back to the RPM business Remember they go like this denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance Well I go through all five stages by the minute in no particular order Right this second as we speak I m bargaining What if I just smoke one cigarette a day How bad could that be Maybe just on Sundays Now I ve jumped over to anger I m furious that I even had that thought to begin with I should know better than that Now I m depressed because I shouldn t be this weak You see Does this happen to you Let s sit down Let s breathe in this clean air Fmmm Ahhh I think the sensory deprivation tank really did me some good I scorned myself for romanticizing and speaking of smoking s beauty the other day but it is now clear that I was getting at something If those of us who are quitting truly are in some sense grieving I suppose we ought to treat it much like the departure of a loved one We often hear the platitude Go through the process yet since we are already indulging in clich s let us admit it into practice Let s go through the process Let s look back on our smoking days with love Let us remember fondly those times we enjoyed a cigarette with a friend or more enticingly with ourselves When the weather was just right and we swam into that blue smoke that would beautify a sunrise or texturize a night sky Let us accept our love for the cigarette Yet let us accept that it is over It must end Ahead new things await us Such is the game Fmmm Ahhh I realize this might be the last time we meet There might be nothing to say about the matter it could just be a cycle of the same stuff As I mentioned the other day I have a visit to the beach and the gym on schedule I will be going there now Maybe we ll run into one another sometime But for now I think that what we ve left to do is just trudge Trudge forward one step one revolution per minute I cannot thank you enough for coming to visit these three days I wish you the very best my friend May call you that Yes Oh that relieves me a great deal My friend Remember the D model version of myself Who knows perhaps next time we run into each other I ll have become him Goodbyes are always though us addicts are really bad at them eh Anyways I ll be keeping in mind this thing about grief so that it doesn t catch me by surprise when it hits again in a minute Fmmm Ahhh It s hitting me now in fact Okay I won t make you stay any longer This is it A good proper formal G O O D B Y E,I m quitting Part ,0
3154,Hi everyone It s my th day after yrs of chainsmoking Minimum packs a day to a point where I was carrying cartons in my luggage if I was travelling Tried to quit multiple times but failed Patch pineapple e ciggs hookah nothing works on me Now it s the toughest time in my life where I lost my mum to covid months back dad has medical complications which need attention asap my business is in ruins I have a huge debt on my head I have an axial tear in my left knee which is pending and a year old toothache had finally revisited twice last month I was forced into avoiding smoking for days after a complicated dental surgery with a fear that it will complicate my toothache for a lifetime I was eagerly waiting for the th day but now I am hoping I can kick this habit once and for all Yesterday was mum s bday baked a cake for the st time but had to throw it due to a foolish mistake Later I found out that dad had made a very critical mistake in his life savings investment The anger stress and anxiousness really kicked up the urge to smoke I am trying not to cave in but now I find myself awake in the middle of the night going through Reddit and asking everyone to place a bet on me if I start smoking if I don t P S I don t think I can do it But again it s a do or die for me ,Place your wagers To smoke or not to smoke ,0

3156,In the US here I found a post on the Book of Faces where they were looking for people to participate in a Phase B study for cytisine Cytisine triggers the receptors in the brain that nicotine does I signed up and completed weeks of the double blind study IT WORKED My quit date was one week after starting the medicine The first thing I noticed while I was smoking and taking cytisine was that I didn t want to finish my ciggie What is it It is from a tree root It is over the counter in most of Europe and Canada In Canada it is called CRAVV The first week was hard but I made it through with little cravings Here is how I did it Treated myself as if I was sick After I finished work I ate and went to bed Slept a lot Drank A LOT of water Water water water Want a ciggie Drink some water Chewed a lot of gum Acknowledged that I was addicted to smoking It wasn t a nasty habit It was a dyed in the wool addiction and needed to be treated as such Quit No going back Talk to your support system when you are weak but acknowledge it is an addiction The side effects were mild Heartburn that was easily treated with Tums or Prilosec Insomnia which I treated with over the counter Unisom Aside from that nothing No crazy dreams No stomach upset No change in mood Here is the kicker I smoked every day for FORTY YEARS I did not think the trial would work but I was desperate to try anything I had tried and failed in the past I tried with Chantix but the side effects were too hard This time it just feels different I can honestly say I have gone a day without craving a cigarette So hopefully cytisine will be approved by the FDA for OTC use in the US The Canadian price point puts it cheaper than a pack of cigarettes My test group was weeks of taking cytisine mg x day If you are in Canada or can have a Canadian friend send you CRAVV DO IT Good luck and may the Force be with you to all the people out there on this journey I know it is hard but you can do it PS If you are in the process of quitting by cutting down Do Not Relight a Cigarette The nicotine is much higher in a short than a regular unused cigarette ,Four months and going strong,0

3168,There are many reasons I quit smoking I d like to give you this romanticized story of why I quit maybe for another post but for right now there are two topics I d like to discuss I am a runner hiker walker I have been sonfor the last years or so Even at the height of my smoking Before that I worked in the restaurant business so I ve never been shy about standing on my feet In the past year and some change my leg will be hard to walk on stiff and sometimes painful when I smoked I quit in April and in July took a trip to celebrate I couldn t believe how much longer I was able to walk and run over my vacation I relapsed weeks ago when I transitioned back into work and now I have made it through a week of quitting My leg has no pain what so ever and I don t do the bouncy leg thing anymore I have had only two ear infections in my life One after I quit in April and this week after quitting again This one was much more painful and I think the ear pain alone will keep from relapsing ever again In fact I can say with almost complete certainty that I m done relapsing and I have QUIT Everything else be damned I gifted myself a Garmin watch for exercise last Christmas so I constantly measure heart rate sleep calories etc The number one thing I noticed after I relapsed this LAST time was sleep I would sleep or hours but it would show that I only received like hours worth of good sleep Smoking cigarettes before bed had totally messed up my rest This past week of quitting I have slept sometimes hours of the day I realize that sleep differences are probably pretty common but I ve never spoken to anyone who has experienced the leg or the ear thing Anyone got any experiences with that ,Crazy Leg Pain Ear Pain and Sleep Anyone else experience ,0
3169,Hey so I tried to quit smoking a lot of times I started smoking when I was and now I m I was with my ex for years and she hated cigarettes for many reasons She always forced me to quit sometimes I did and sometimes I lied to her just to smoke and it caused us a lot of problems during the relationship We are separate for months and I quit after reading the book the easy way by Allen Car Most of the times I don t feel the need to smoke and I was in one week vacation with a lot of views and didn t even smoke The thing is I m speaking with so many people that quit also people who quit after reading the book or went to any other place that helps And a lot of them got back to smoke after months months couple of weeks In counting every day free but really afraid of getting back to smoking someday Im really really don t want to smoke even one cigarette ever again Is there any help or tips you guys can give me Thank you all , days free and many,0
3170,I have a Kitchen Safe and have been using it The problem I find is that once the box is locked for the preset time you can t open it So if you buy another pack of cigarettes you can t put the new pack in until it opens again so if you are prone to chain smoke then you can do that until the box opens again which could be hours away or all day Anyway just wondering what other people s experience with time delay safes are whether they really work I know even one a day isn t really quitting And I d be better off with nicotine replacement but I have done one a day for like a week at a time so it has worked Just wondering if it can work long term because I do break down and end up buying more packs before the safe opens sometimes ,Anyone use Kitchen Safe time delay box to smoke just one or two cigarettes per day ,0
3171,Here I am again I have stopped smoking several times before I am on day again Cold Turkey as I always do I was thinking about all the previous times I started smoking again and it is always the same pattern I quit smoking Somehow I find it fairly easy I know the cravings only last a couple of minutes so I white knuckled them On the first few days I have a craving every hour or so by the nd week is once a day or every other day So I know I just need to keep going until I realize I am not thinking about smoking anymore So I get cocky It s normally on a night out when I am drinking with friends after being smoke free for a while I think to myself Oh I ve not smoked for X amount of weeks months let me have one drag here it will be fine I am not addicted anymore Famous last words I do not know what happens to me Maybe I will just have one cigarette on that night out but it s like if I woke a little craving monster inside me So it s pretty much guaranteed that I will begin to reason how if I just bought a package it wouldn t be so bad as I can always stop again and all that crap And one of the lies that I tell myself is nobody will know Because I feel deeply ashamed of my stop start relationship with tobacco And I will buy some cigarettes and I will smoke again So I know that I cannot smoke I just need to make the decision not to smoke ever again Day eventually will become Month and hopefully Year Please wish me luck ,I cannot smoke Not even a single puff ,0
3172,Thank you ,Nearly five years ago I quit smoking A few users on this sub gave me words of encouragement in my toughest time I m still smoke free Thank you ,0
3173,When I first tried to quit smoking it was like hell A poisonous mist crawled inside my head Everything seemed blank and meaningless I hoped it would get better but it didn t get better Day after day life was bleak and everything seemed disgusting On the third day I was completely run out of willpower and started to smoke again My second attempt to quit was very much the same But on the third time something changed Yeah it still wasn t easy but I was noticing that it was going so much better then my previous attempts I was able to enjoy reading and conversations with friends I didn t want to pity myself instead I took walks and was doing some joyful things What was the reason it was so much easier for me Well I don t know for sure but I have some ideas Previously I thought that quiting smoking it s all about health and money And to be honest I didn t care much about health but I had problems with money So I felt like quiting smoking it s not really my decision but rather something I must do because of external circumstances My attitude was like I like smoking but if I don t quit I will be punished So the process of quiting was a lot like punishment to me But then something happened I was kind of depressed And kind of bored Pndemic you know I was sitting at home most of the time And I was chainsmoking one cigarette after other One after other One after other I mean really every minutes or so Well maybe every minutes but still I realisied I m really sick of this shit And then I read some books about smoking And I realisied something Previously what a naive fool I really thought cigarettes are harmfull for health but they make your mood better and increase concentration I thought health and money is a price I pay to feel better And I was quite ok with that price But how surprised I was the moment I found out cigarettes make your mood worse and dicrease your concentration So what s a point Maybe that s why third time it was much easier for me to not smoke My attitude changed I was no longer thinking smoking is great but if I continue smoking I will be punished I was thinking smoking is just pointless and ridiculous You know English is not my native language so it s not easy for me to write in it When I was a smoker it was so hard for me to concentrate while writing in English I needed to take breaks and smoke every minutes because I believed without this shit I can t write a word And now look I wrote it all in one go Life is really better without smoking ,To those who think their life will never be the same,0

3175,Lot s of stress but this whole month has been like that Today was quite the doozie Something happened just now to trigger my irritability and I figured fuck this Someone in my house has a pack and I took one Not even my brand Smoked half of it and it wasn t even enjoyable didn t even calm me or give me what I thought it would Put it out half way Still though from a pack a day to zero for a month isn t bad I don t feel like I threw all that away or anything I won t be buying any In a way I m glad I did so I don t have to pine after them Now I know for certain cigarettes suck This almost reminds me of how I quit for years before this I was so frustrated that I smoked a pack as quickly as I could and got incredibly sick Intense nausea and a panic attack I just laid there thinking I was going to die For years after that I didn t have the slightest craving at all Even around my friends who would smoke Even if I was out drinking Every time I want a cigarette I m going to look back at today and remind myself that they re shit My motivation was absolutely self destructive Like a more socially acceptable form of cutting or something emo like that Never Fucking Again Stay strong people Fuck ,Fuck I cracked and smoked one after a month of cold turkey Not even pleasurable ,0
3176,i m a little upset with myself i broke a four day streak due to stress and went out and bought a pack i went on a vacay with the guy i m dating now i m aware of how gross my mouth feels how dry it is and how bad it smells just got off the phone with the guy i m dating who told me it was a huge turnoff for him he said it s one of the main thing s he doesn t like about me he s worried about how my health will be in years and it s a huge long term concern of his your mouth is dry your voice is raspy you smell like smoke you taste like smoke you re preoccupied i know i should stop smoking for myself and i really want to but it s hard duh he s a major factor in me quitting so i guess that s a good thing i am doing it for myself whatever i bought the nicoderm patches and i was doing great and then i just caved after some personal stress throw some words of wisdom please or a joke are there AA type groups for stopping smoking not only am i powerless against alcohol but also even worse around cigarettes i don t drink every day but i can t remember the last time i went without smoking unless i was deathly ill facepalm sad emojis ,broke a day streak is there AA for smokers ,0

3178,So my mom likes to smoke tobacco inside the house Most of the time I just go inside another room but sometimes I just get really annoyed and I tell her if she could just stop especially if she smokes around my younger siblings I know it s not simple to stop but my mom seems to not have a plan of stopping smoking She even insists to me that tobacco is good because it s different from cigarettes I tell her about scientific studies regarding how tobacco is still bad but she tells me these studies are just bull h t She tells me that many of her elders who smoked tobacco lived long Can I do anything ,My mom insists that tobacco is good,0

3180,Hey all I started smoking years ago at like a fool First an odd one while drinking then rolling then regular packs after a while Last few months I was at packs a day on my way to chain smoking I tried to stop smoking a few times but I guess I really didn t want to stop Last monday I decided to read Alan Carrs book and quit on the spot Threw of pack to thrash and never looked back The thing is I don t have any cravings or withdrawal symptoms at all I m just fine with it All my usual triggers for smoking are still here stress boredom coffee hanging out but I just have no desire to smoke I ve been reading this subreddit and I m kind of worried how some people have horrible withdrawal and cravings and I just managed to stop I don t think about cigarretes and if I think about smoking it s just a fleeting thought which goes away in a second I know I kinda sound pompous but I really don t intend to light one ever again Anyone have any similar stories ,Worried about it being to easy for lack of a better word ,0
3181,After prepping myself for a hellacious three days I m proud to say it s going better than I expected I ve had to remind myself a few more times today of my reasons for quitting but overall I haven t actually had any physical symptoms It s frustrating that my spouse smokes but I m determined I told myself I wouldn t smoke past years and I just keep reminding myself that this is the longest I ve gone cold turkey I don t want to start the process over so I just push through Thank you all for sharing your encouragement ,Day not so bad,0

3184,According to google it takes your body three days to be rid of nicotine I promised I d be in better shape this time around Eh What do you think You smell that Fresh mountain air My skin s looking better no Step in let me show you around What s that Oh that fence and tarp covering that dusty area over there Never mind that Let me give you a fresh tour of the place To start at the top my nappy hair has undergone some slight improvement already although that might be due to my increased ingestion of liquids A new habit Oral fixation by way of a variety of zero cal sparkling waters My skin did I already mention that I didn t Okay well if you haven t noticed it s looking a little better after just three days can you believe it It s a new landscape on my face new roofing now without my pores having to act like chimneys to the chemical factory I had running in my mouth and throat Which takes me to my teeth and gums They feel significantly less septic which has improved my self esteem a great deal The kernel like teeth are still sporting their bronzing but now that that journey is less futile I might be more motivated to get on the whitening caravan Ick I ll become one of them you know the type I m talking about Going lower the noticeable improvements extend to a wellness in the throat something that s easy to take for granted I remember how much I felt the need to cough and spit just a few days ago Recall the length of the nicotine flush I mentioned While I looked at that I found some other facts of the home improvement type not necessarily smoking related Skin cells are replaced every thirty nine days Red blood cells are replaced every one hundred and twenty days And the entire skeleton is replaced every ten years Crazy no A sign that we can really truly cleanse ourselves from the abuse of chemicals down to the very core of our beings literally Together one day we can be the proud owners of an all new non smoking clean energy eco friendly TSA approved body Oh the lungs you wonder apparently it takes them up to nine months to repair That s quick if you ask me But don t quote me on any of this I just googled things with a delirious need for validation Google images at that too a graphic I couldn t even bother reading a proper article I could keep going with my graphic borrowed stats it s very interesting actually but as soothing and sobering as my visible improvements and scientific facts can be they can only do so much in the irrational mind of a smoker Stats are nice but have they ever really affected us Have we ever really cared We ve known them all along I can prove to you how irrational I am by admitting that I genuinely think smoking is a beautiful thing I have to accept it Rehabilitation is all about being honest no Or maybe it is that life is beautiful and cigarettes just give that fact an additional emphasis Smoking can be an enhancement of a sunset a walk in the night a morning coffee Isn t it It is Please don t shame me Alright shame me I deserve it It is often brought up that these feelings come from being brainwashed by Hollywood and what lingers from the days when cigarettes were advertised favorably But I would argue that the sensuality of the cigarette came before the advert Let s not mistake things here The beauty is intrinsic for not even science humanity s most beautiful practice before singing and smoking and storytelling has been able to turn us off to it Cigarettes are beautiful but much in the same way maybe that a mushroom cloud can be beautiful or a snotty smoggy phlegmy apocalyptic LA sunset can be beautiful or solar flares or a tragic life Forgive me for talking about the beauty of smoking again Am I repeating myself It doesn t escape me that I might sound like some nihilistic teenager but I promise you the sentiment is more mature than that Will you take me on that promise I ve not a good track record have I Well I m changing that now aren t I I m sorry I m not in as good a shape as I expected Forgive me for yelling at you you re the last person to deserve it As you can see I m still dealing with a bit of irritability as part of the withdrawal process This comes along with spells of attention deficit and a displacement feeling that I can only compare to that of when you hop off of the treadmill after a good masochistic session with it You feel the world rolling and moving without you enjoying itself without you That s how I feel Left behind unable to appreciate the world around me without the slim companion limping on my lip The truth is with all my attempted optimism which I know it might not be much in the brain the nicotine telephone still rings every few minutes If I hadn t anything to do I could ignore it more easily But I m trying to get on with my day Shut up okay It looks beautiful outside It calls for me It was nice enjoying the sunset without a cigarette Which says everything about the beauty of nature but nothing about the sweet company of a cigarette But I have to carry on When am I going to believe that quitting was a good idea I keep wondering The morals Gernoymous The morals of it all It s getting late thank you for stopping by I know I said I d be in better shape believe me I was but things shift by the minute over here In an instant a traffic jam A cursing protester Sirens Telephones Emails Mail Money Bills Three days and counting for me No actually minutes and counting is more like it Let s catch up later I have things to sort out Thanks for stopping by Drive home safe Your presence was almost as enjoyable a cig Thanks for putting up with me You keep looking at that fence and tarp Huh Alright whatever let s walk over there I ll show you Behind it I m building something A new me I m just embarrassed about it Anyways yes a new me Here see this picture zip tied to the fence It s a D rendered model of what I ll look like in the future Look at the set of choppers on me Look at me I have healthy D modeled children and have promising prospects to get to know my grandchildren too I ve also in this picture of the future me acquired a new physique since part of my growth has included going to the gym and eating more subtly and therefore healthier That s what I think eating healthy is about subtlety When will I get my super human tastebuds back Do you know Search it up and let me know Anyways back to the D rendered version of me I have radiant young skin too I know the D artists were too nice to me but who knows Don t laugh at me It ll take some time to get there but I will be completed someday A

3185, I m never going to smoke again Isn t it marvelous Will be my mantra for the next month Today marks years that I broke my first quit that lasted months This one is my final quit A day I will not forget ever years ago today my eldest was born and despite my mom begging me not to I decided to have a celebratory cigarette like back in the day of birth cigars men used to have I quit for another months with my second child and came right back It is time The madness of years of smoking is done I m never going to smoke again isn t it marvelous , cigarettes and left of Allan Carr s audio book,0
3186,So this will be a post to remember myself that this is my last cigarette I smoked for years cigarettes per day I began because my father who is a non smoker kept packs of cigarettes in plain sight and one day I took some to go to parties then to smoke alone in my backward after arguments with my family My father never recognized the stupidity of tempting me like this but shouted on me all the time for smoking which obviously didn t work My anxiety issues and smoking were feeding each other badly Smoking for no reason all the time between every classes subway travel when bored eating and drinking to smoke more smoking in my room at work alone The worst things it did was for my sleep pattern smoking at night always keep me awake until the morning and my life has many times endured the consequences of that Also I used to be very athletic and now my body is just a container that is not using its incredible abilities for sport My libido went completely down my skin is sagging and uneven even my hair is sparse I tried to stop at least times from days to months so I want this to be the last attempt There will be no better moment in my life to stop smoking that now Good luck to all those who are stopping and stick to it ,My last cigarette,0
3187,I was able to stay strong for month weeks and days All it took was phone call from an old friend some reminiscing and him telling me I don t sound so convinced about quitting Next thing I know i m holding one cigarette debating with myself whether or not to smoke it I won t lie I really enjoyed that cigarette I was about to go buy myself a whole pack but somehow managed not to I don t want to smoke but I think that s only temporary I feel so ashamed of myself At first I felt like all my progress went out the window but maybe it does not have to be It was a setback but I can still salvage it Right ,I caved in,0
3188,I m been vaping for about a year now Had two instances where i quit once around three months after i first started that lasted like a month because i got hit by a motorcycle and everything was super stressful so i caved and started again for another two months Then the XC season came around and i thankfully recovered fast enough to have my senior season i quit for three months but then i started again and haven t been able to stop I promised myself when this vape died i would quit but i m desperate rn and hitting old burnt vapes lmfao Don t know why it s so hard this time i quit cold turkey both times before but this is so hard No idea what to do what has helped y all quit ,Struggling to quit vaping,0
3189,I m on day years quit once before lockdown and work stress caused a relapse of years can t believe it s been years of this shit Yes I read the book Anyway right now my brain is making a lot of deals with myself and I m doing mental gymnastics to try and trick myself into smoking What really helps to get me out of this state is reading the stories of people who succeeded and have graduated to the enlightened oh shit that was an addiction my life is so much better phase Can people share their positive stories or possibly link me to threads with lots of positive stories so I can take a look when I m feeling tempted Thank you ,Can I get some positive stories ,0
3190,Now I know what you re thinking but I hate running Me too I am not a natural runner and I really dislike almost everything about it But I decided to go for a run with my dog once After less than two km I was out of breath I thew in the towel and told my dog I was sorry but I was never doing that again A few months later I was a week into my nth attempt at quitting smoking after being a smoker for years I happened to see the app on my phone Rundoggo that I d used to log my run Curiosity got the best of me and I laced up and went for a run My distance was a tiny bit better Running was the most direct way I found to measure my progress Nothing else compares You can feel when your lungs are done when your body is out of oxygen and you have to stop And you slowly feel yourself regaining that lung capacity and you can see the progress in a measured way in km and minutes and seconds Obviously not everyone can go running but if you can and haven t considered it before I really encourage you to A doggo always helps Keep up the good fight my friends ,Running how something I hated helped me quit,0
3191,Hello to all Today it s finally been years i have quite smoking First attempted after years of a heavy daily even when hospitalize consumption I m happy and enjoying the additional time i got Getting used to go around with less objects my skins looks amazing this grey face just left for a peachy glow But i still need to keep myself aware that this strong addiction is waiting for me at any moment I still even if it s less and less leaving dangerous setting to be sure I wouldn t smoke I know it s still a big weakness that i can fall back at any moment I do know that even a puff on a cigarette would lead me to a pack in less then a week years ago I went cold turkey Cried everyday for weeks and couldn t believe how many action where starting or ending with a smoke How I could repeat the same action more then time a day which other actions would I repeat per day for years I wanted to have a special day with my close one s to celebrate and enjoy this special date for me While proposing a different activity the main comment received it s How come you are still on this you are a none smoker now It s so so wrong I still fully enjoy the smell of warm smoke cigarette cigar weed what ever I find my mind fantasy on smoking to enjoy to coffee to congratulate or to come over a frustration I find my mind creating great excuses to have one All this to say I am happy I over come all my addictions and manage to have a more or less a healthy life but mainly I m grateful I have the capacity to identify when weakness is around the corner I will keep reminding me that I m too weak addicted to ever taste it again Happy years to me and whising all the future and none smoker to continue ,This th of September it has been years,0

3193,Been smoking since I was or I m now days into being and and a half days into my quit It s rough but nicotine gum helps Being stuck in an apartment hiding from the world due to the pandemic has helped by isolating me away from other smomers and hurt by leaving me pretty endlessly bored But I m making it day by day And if I can change after years of stupidity I promise you can too ,Quitting for the last time again,0
3194,Woke up yesterday itching for a smoke Rode through it Woke up again today wanting it even more Went out to go to therapy the one time a week I leave my city and go to Tokyo and everywhere I looked there were cigarettes The guy in front of me on the train had a Marlboro shirt on then I went to the dollar store and the first thing I saw was a gag cigarette pack buzzer thing ads at all the convenience stores eventually I just caved and bought a pack on my way home Idk Just too depressed to quit right now I guess And it s so easy to smoke here a pack Smoking areas everywhere I guess what triggered it was a couple days ago my dad telling me he s disappointed in me for trying to commit suicide a couple months ago and having to take time off work because in his eyes I was the kid who was gonna make everything good in my life cause I went to college to work in Japan and that was my dream since I was a kid And I made it happen and apparently that s supposed to get rid of my mental illnesses And all I could think was of how hard I m trying to get better I m in therapy x a week working out eating better quitting cigarettes yet I m still a disappointment Sorry for the rant just need to get it out ,Caved after weeks smoke free ,0
3195,I m at the end of day two It s been rough non stop cravings almost every minute About an hour ago I went to the shops fully intending to crack Mind you I was still a little split on the decision I ve had a few failed attempts in a row so I ve cut down pretty significantly this past month As a result my sense of smell and taste are back and when I left my apartment I was hit with the full feel and smell of the new spring It felt amazing By the time I reached the shops though a couple had just exited and were having a dart break outside It seemed so nice I thought then and there I was cracking for sure now But when it came to pay for the groceries in a split second decision I turned towards the self checkout avoiding the manned ciggerette kiosk It felt nuts it barely felt like I was the one making the movements Once I paid I still had to walk past the kiosk to the exit And I did but once again it barely felt like I was in control It was almost as if and I know this sounds bizarre like my cravings were stopping me from buying them It honestly felt exciting I was cheering myself on as I walked home Truth is though I think every day I ve tried to quit this month has been like that Once I get past day it gets a lot easier and then I have other problems but I deal with those when it comes D but prior to that I feel completely out of control Perhaps this is normal but it almost feels as if it s luck that is leading me to quit rather than myself having control over the process I m kind of fine with that if it s just the process of beating withdrawals but if anyone has any advice or tips on getting that control back and maybe making quitting more of a sure thing I m definitely open to it ,I feel completely mad is there an easier way ,0
3196,I m almost years old and it s my th attempt to quit smoking I know from previous experience that quitting is not easy So I decided to use power of reddit and to make posts about my experience during at least next days To be honest I m tired of smoking I m tired to be nervous about buying cigarettes all the time what happens if closest shop is closed I m tired to be not able to do literally anything without damn cylinders of death literally I need to smoke even before I can wipe my ass lol But most of all I m tired of drinking things I don t mean alcohol I mean all kinds of drinks You don t get my point You don t understand what am I trying to say sorry English is not my native language so there might be a lot of mistakes in my writings Well if You are curious I can explain I find smoking most enjoyfull when I can drink something while smoking Coffee tea milk beer etc So if I m not in hurry I always drink something while smoking And I smoke a lot Something like cigarettes per day It means during day I drink something about cups of coffee tea beer water right No Actually I drink a lot more Because everyone knows that coffee dehydrates Thus for every cup of coffee I drink one or two glasses of water So I drink I guess about drinks per day It s not a problem until I need to go out Because when I need to go out I have a lot of water inside of me and I m afraid that I will piss my pants yeah I know how miserable that sounds if there are no toilets in place where I am going And I actually like to go out I like to take walks go to cinema concerts etc I m not extraverted but sometimes I just need to get some new impressions you know And I can t do that So I have three last cigarettes left I smoke them and then I quit Because I m so so so bored of sitting at home all the time ,My th attempt to quit,0

3199,Yo I m making the steps towards quitting again I m having some trouble because smoking is pretty intertwined with my art and writing so it s a challenge to undo those behaviours but I m working on it I quit for years up until about months ago and prior to that smoked almost a full pack a day I think I only quit because I moved country and everything was new but I made sure to internalize the positives of being smoke free I think what I miss most about not smoking is breathing properly I walk a lot and it s often through a very steep wood Despite doing this daily for months and now being relatively fit it s still much more taxing than it should be That sucks I m also pretty paranoid about my mortality generally I have things I want to accomplish and it sucks to think that I m actively contributing to that ending prematurely I have a fortunate unfortunate reference point in my grandparents in that respect They re both lifelong smokers that are pushing and haven t had any cancer scares or anything like that so it s hard to silence the part of my brain that tells me that I ll be fine too I know it s just a lottery and the risk is not worth it but you know how it is Anyway I bought some patches I got the low dose even though I smoke about a day atm I ve been supplementing that with the occasional cheeky smoke with the end goal of cutting them out entirely as I work on changing my behaviours So far so good I found that the medium dose made me feel really nauseous and unable to work but the low dose seems to be doing the trick so far I ve found that mindset is important I m pretty pessimistic as a person My smoking is very much tied to the notion that life is short and pointless so why try kinda thing I know that this is only really relevant for the first month of quitting From experience after the first month and beyond it gets SOOOOO much easier Anyway thanks for listening Good luck buddies ,Just a post because I don t talk to anyone about this stuff,0

3229,Come in Watch your step Under here Yes Excuse the mess the place is undergoing heavy construction Today is my first day nicotine free in five years I stopped yesterday morning when I was made aware by my patient and loving wife that my breath was out of the ordinary The euphemism used was alarming to me even more so than if she had flat out told me that it stank I had before experienced odd dry throat spells followed by odd fumes coming from back there after prolonged vaping sessions But the tone of voice my wife employed it got to me In absolute embarrassment I threw the trendy new Flum away I should tell you that it s not my first time quitting or stopping momentarily for oral health reasons which are the first to arise and here I am again craving it as I switch from writing to video editing and back with a bad case of attention deficit I m chewing gum sipping on sparkling tonic to keep my body busy but oh how I miss nicotine presently in it in its most embracing and beautiful form a cigarette A good way to go about it is by not buying them I admit if I had a squashed pack at the bottom of any backpack in my surmounting closet I would go for it But I know for a fact there are no spare packs lying around anywhere It was made sure of when I scrambled through everything I owned where I could find even a fractured ciggie last I tried quitting I am good at repairing them by the way at healing them rehabilitating them You know perhaps that jacket hold on Nothing Forget it Another thing that helps is reminding yourself of the benefits I believe this is common practice in the therapies of quitting but I have no experience with professionals on this sort of thing I just know what I know and I can t help but think I d be further embarrassed if I had to seek paid advice for such a thing as this Come on I know I m not trying to shame anyone that is aided the professional help they are braver and less sluggish than I but I have standards for myself that I don t have for others So I refuse I can indeed do this on my own maybe I know many that have done it and with fewer struggles than this I am mad Mad I type with clasped middle and index fingers craving for the hold Then follows reminding myself of the more notorious consequence of smoking That famous Great Evil Cancer However if you are someone like me or have ever met someone like me you would know that we treat our relationship with the Great Evil with distant acknowledgment And for that we are sort of immune to this mode of fear mongering and for a long time Practically since we began The old It happens to others but not to me sort of thing is a common trait in the immunity How unfashionable it has become to smoke hasn t it Amongst the degrading no smoking signs teenage vaping and marijuana s acceptance it s become reproachable even It s a good thing It helps us all But at the same time for someone like me that hasn t ever really cared to obtain other people s approval it kind of provokes me further Alright tuck in your shirt Geronymous this is bordering on the immoral It s alright to have disregard for one s own health but it is plainly insulting and nasty to willingly walk on the road toward Cancerlandia when cleaner souls are forced and packed into the bullet train there Get a grip man Okay that helped The moral angle for all of this helps It hasn t quite yet done it for the quit eating meat thing I am giving a shot to pescetarianism but that s a subject for another day As you can see the gears in me are operating erratically My system is asking for that chemical that commandeers the factory within Dope the workers that keep me going Their angry the workers in me Protesting they are wondering why they are forced into labor without the usual spurts of dopamine I hope they don t start any fires They ve started a fire They want me to walk over to the nearest store now There are three convenient places around Very convenient stores I call them I m reminded of when that American term truly sunk in when I dragged myself to one searching for the comfort of that rectangular box in my pant pocket Delivery is also an option that s even more convenient than convenience I ve got all the apps for that Name one I have it address and credit card en queue I stepped onto my balcony to breathe air for a moment I know you are disappointed in me coming that close to caving in Of what use will the balcony have now Will I renew my lease here I m overpaying for this great view of Los Angeles for what To look at without the lovely company of the blue smoke at my fingertips There are a lot of decisions to be made now with all these changes Turns out cigarettes were deciding on where I lived This is a coup This is a coup What now Oh boy The factory workers come marching wondering what s going on Wondering why the commander s chair is empty While you ve been here I ve researched the nicotine gum the patches the mints It all sounds very unappetizing to be honest If I am quitting I should go all the way through Right Do you agree Right But now I sit without a commander in chief Who will lead now Now comes the wagering Realistically how likely is it that another year of smoking will cause serious harm to my body Remind yourself of the benefits again You must forgive me if I am all over the place My mind is undergoing heavy maintenance as you can see Watch your step I ask that you forgive me Perhaps you should drop by another time I promise to be in better shape Thank you for dropping by and listening You were very kind to me it d truly hurt me to disappoint you I promise until next time I ll be good I ll behave Deep down I know it s worth it ,I m quitting,0

3233,To give a bit of backstory my dad smoked cigarettes since high school before recently switching to vaping and it s been since years since then I remember one time my middle school was talking about how bad smoking was and I went home and told him to stop smoking He yelled at me and told me to never bring it up again I apologized shortly after and all was forgiven But that s when I realized that my dad is addicted nicotine My dad and I are very close and I m scared for him because he s smoking a lot now especially since he s switched to vaping He says that it s better than when he was smoking cigarettes because there s no bad smell which I guess is true but he s completely ignoring the fact that he s addicted and I m really scared for him I want him to stop I really do but I don t want him to shut me out like he did all those years ago So in this case for a person who s been smoking for most of their life how do I get my dad to start slowing down before something serious starts to happen to him ,My Dad has been addicted to Nicotine for years and I m very scared for him ,0

3254,As the title says I am smoke free for months now days month ago i broke up with my ex girlfriend because I was being a dick and was only focussing on myself school and sports I regret it but its over now I quit smoking because of her back in December I fucking miss her and I feel lonely I think the nicotine can actually refill that place Its frustrating because every day I am tempted to smoke I just needed to vent this and to be honest I think I will start smoking again ,The urge to smoke gets bigger by the day,0
3255,Seven months ago I decided I was going to give up all forms of nicotine After a few weeks of cravings and general aggravation I began suffering from one of the worst depressive episodes I have ever experienced To be quite honest I had very little interest in being alive for the first three to five months I know this sounds like an overreaction But the reality is that my dependence on this drug went much deeper than I had previously thought It turns out that I had been self medicating since my very first puffs seven years ago With this drug in my system I no longer had to face the anxieties of everyday life without a helping hand and boy did I squeeze that hand when I needed it I wanted to share my experience with you because it will probably not be as easy as they said it would be Your lows may be lower and it will likely take longer before the cravings pass In fact for me the cravings went very quickly But what lingered was a general lack of enthusiasm for life a pit in my stomach as a looked towards the future and a childish frustration towards the world around me I found that it is the subtlety of it all that will get to you However today I feel gratitude Thankful that I made it through the long days the dark nights I gave myself a gift by quitting The gift of a more consistent life I may now treat those around me with more love and respect than I ever could when life was always on a ticking clock eagerly awaiting my next puff so I could just buy myself a little more time I now experience a more consistent outlook more frequently than ever am I content Life will never be perfect but at least now I am not punishing myself for a ten minute buzz and a false breath of fresh air Love yourself quit ,Seven Months Seven Years my perspective on quitting,0
3256,I have a not so terrible nicotine addiction I don t use nicotine daily but often a few times a week I have a difficult time resisting nicotine when I m around people who are using it Specifically if someone has a Juul vape l or a nicotine pouch zyn I ll often bum off them I ve smoked dipped vaped in the past but never at an extreme level of usage I do smoke a cigar several times a month but this I truly enjoy and am not willing to let go of The cognitive dissonance of nicotine usage is what plagues my conscious My problem is l I m having an extremely difficult time resisting the use of nicotine outside of the occasional cigar I want to abandon this for good My lifestyle is extremely healthy outside of this bad addiction I m gonna post in this thread to keep myself accountable,My not so terrible addiction,0

3260,I ve smoked for the last years and had my last cigarette about months ago I used a vape to finally kick the smoking habit and it worked like a charm picked up a caliburn G for online mg free base juice wasn t enough so I had to switch to mg salt nic That did the trick and made it rather easy to remove smoking from my mind While an argument can certainly be made that vaping is less harmful than smoking it is not a risk free and safe method of nicotine consumption like many think I was noticing some tightness in my chest and slightly labored breathing so I decided it was time to quit vaping Boy howdy even with the patches this has been difficult but just a week in and I feel a lot better It s amazing how much damage that vape was doing to me I feel like using the vape to get off cigarettes was the right choice It made it relatively easy to end the smoking habit and I m now quitting a habit that I ve been doing for less than a year rather than one that has been snowballing for That said I vaped differently that I smoked Rather than go out for a few puffs every other hour like smoking it was more like puffs every minutes I am almost always in an environment that allows me to vape freely so I was almost always vaping It just complimented everything I did and I m finding the habit hard to get over The hardest parts are after meals and when I first wake up which is why I m typing this wall of rambling as a way to distract my mind Meals just don t feel complete unless I take a few puffs and chain smoking vaping has been my morning ritual for as long as I can remember I honestly can t remember a time when it wasn t this way I started by using the mg patch and mg juice days ago I used the mg juice for a day to take the edge off and mg juice for a day and a half after that I ve since abstained from any vaping and am just using the mg patch I still have my vape but if I wanted to use it I d have to go to the store to buy a coil I always sleep with my patch on because it makes my dreams beyond fucked up and i enjoy crazy terrifying dreams a lot I woke up today and the withdrawals weren t that bad I decided I m going to leave yesterday s patch on and am going to try to go the day without putting a new one on Those bitches are crazy expensive so I ll be thrilled if I never have to use one again What has been the hardest times for you to quit smoking and or vaping What are some things you ve done or thought about that have helped you to stay strong For me a huge thing is that I find smoking and vaping to be pathetic and immature I respect how strong of an addiction it is and that many of us started when we were young and stupid but I still find the entire thing to be childish embarrassing and self loathing has always been a strong motivator for me That and I lived with a grandparent that has copd and emphysema and a friend of mine has really bad throat cancer She s a lovely person but being around her is a unpleasant reminder of what s awaiting me if I don t get my shit together To add to the whole me being embarrassed of this habit thing being over at a friend s seeing my friends smoke as this poor woman is violently blowing snot through the hole in her throat just adds to the whole cringe factor of this stupid decision I m impressed that you actually read this whole thing It helped me to get over the need to be vaping right now Sorry there wasn t really a point to this post I just needed to vent and occupy my mind as I woke up I m gonna go make some oatmeal with peanut butter maple syrup apple chunks and raisins Wish me luck ,Day and mornings are rough,0

3263,Hi everyone I m on day of my quit and it s going mostly well I feel very commitment and I know I made the right choice and am giving myself a precious gift of a smoke free life I have occasional tough cravings even with the patch usually after some wine I m glad I cut up all smokes in the house and don t have many smoker friends Addiction can do such funny things to your brain Tomorrow I m going on a first date and it will be my first date in over a decade as a non smoker It used to give me anxiety to go on first dates as a smoker because I d worry it would turn them off it probably definitely did I d delay the smoke for as long as I could in an effort to make it seem like I wasn t THAT much of a heavy smoker I was The stress of coming out as a smoker non smokers would be so surprised and dismayed when I d light up I don t have to deal with that now and it s amazing I still feel fragile and vulnerable to relapsing but I suspect this will pass and I m only going to get stronger with each day ,First first date as a non smoker ,0
3264,I quit smoking at the beginning of before the pandemic hit to have a healthier body I read Allen Carr s book and used the smoke free app to track my progress It was all going so well I was full of energy cleansed my body was exercising regularly and even quit alcohol for half year Then I started dating someone I thought will be a long term relationship but he gave me the biggest curve ball and broke my trust a few months in In my grieving process I picked up cigarettes again for a month then I quit again Then one of my best friends broke up with me too so cigarettes came back again for a few weeks Then I quit again my ex appeared and stirred me up so I smoked I quit again and got a puppy who turned out to have a serious health issue and needed a surgery so naturally I handled stress with smoking She got better I quit Now it s my rd day of smoking again because I m going through a lot of stress at work and have to change jobs and I know it is temporary but I want this to be my last slip I ve listened to Allen Carr so many times feel like I ve become an expert on the subject but I still go back to my unhealthy coping mechanisms whenever I m going through something emotionally heavy It s been a difficult year for me but I really want to leave these deathsticks behind me and develop healthier strategies for dealing with stressful live events and loss Is anyone out there having similar struggles or can give any good advice on quitting for good ,Quit for almost a year and now I m smoking on and off again,0
3265,pretty much what the headline says I m and quit smoking mid june after being a daily smoker since high school used the so called cold turkey method and I havent touched one since Problem is that I feel awful since then and havent felt little to any improvement I still sleep like crap brain foggy all the time and tiredness and fatigue like crazy When I was a smoker I played sports hiked mountains and had a way higher energy level now I hardly have enough energy to do a mile walk in my neighborhood I don t know what to do with myself I m debating saying Eff this and going back Someone please tell me why I shouldnt and how to combat this shit before I do ,Advice needed quit smoking in June and still feel like total sh t ,0
3266,A lot of times people say I only smoke when I drink or I only smoke socially I used to do that myself till I kicked the habit for good But when you re an addict all it does is bring your addiction to a new level For example I started quitting last year in April when I saw friends share articles about smoking putting you at higher risk for covid I started to smoke only while drinking and only with friends that smoked I did good for the most part and would never smoke at home and made sure to never buy packs a very helpful method but if I was drinking with smokers eventually the cravings would kick in and I found myself smoking a few times a month until I had my last one in December What made me realize I was going on the wrong path was a night of heavy drinking in November and I was bumming smokes off multiple people which I can tell was annoying some people And it s a slippery slope because you don t wanna buy packs and become a regular smoker again but you also don t wanna be a mooch either This is why cold turkey is the best method Not to mention that even if you re only smoking socially I feel like it makes you look forward to those few cigarettes and you might even tell yourself it s ok to do it now I m drinking and then before you know it you re addicted again Even if you don t become a regular smoker again it s possible to make a habit out of social smoking if you drink regularly After some time has passed I m at a point where the smell of smoke is so disgusting that I m actively discouraged to smoke when drinking as opposed to encouraged My anxiety levels have drastically decreased too ,Why social smoking is counterproductive,0

3268,Everyone has their own reasons for quitting whether it s to be healthy save money get in shape or for their family loved ones Regardless of your reason for quitting any reason is legitimate and don t underestimate that There s a reason friends of mine that still smoke are envious of me quitting and tell me good for you Now that doesn t make me better than them or above them but it makes me proud of being able to do something most smokers wish they could do And trust me quitting wasn t easy I can t count how many times I said I was gonna quit or how many slip ups I had till I quit for good Meaning no smokes when drinking or any time ,Any reason is a good reason to quit,0

3271,So this is the first time I ve ever attempted quitting and I had been smoking for over years My addiction to nicotine didn t start going out of hand until this year when I started smoking those disposable vapes Those things are evil and got me hooked to nicotine more than cigarettes They taste great you can have it anywhere they don t make you smell bad and the nicotine percentage is much higher than regular cigarettes I was able to go a day or two without a cigarette but it got to the point where I couldn t even go a couple of hours without hitting the puff bar I was at my campus for the first time in a few weeks we had a lockdown due to covid and it s a huge trigger spot for me as I would chain smoke there I went through most of today fine but later on it got really bad and I was doing laps trying to find someone I could get a cigarette off I didn t manage to find someone and walking actually helped me feel better I m mostly writing this to vent and explain how close of a call that was for me to relapse and how proud of myself I am I don t really tell myself that enough lol but I was wondering if after a certain amount of days of not smoking these strong cravings will go away especially after smoking those puff bars with such a high nicotine percentage pretty consistently ,Almost caved in after hours,0

3274,I started smoking again after quitting months and couldn t quit again After three months of smoking I decided to give vaping a go Its honestly a game changer I have the same packet of cuggerates I bought two weeks ago and despite the rare smoke I have practically stopped There are sometimes cravings but after taking a quick hit of my vape they subside substantially Whilst my vape still has nicotine in it I know it will be a lot easier to lower the amounts over time Its awesome and practical The costs are much lower way more convenient and studies prove it is much healthier than smoking Its probably the best choice I have made to work towards a smoke free lifestyle ,Vaping has helped me quit ciggerates again ,0

3286,Whispers of a damned temptation to smoke again dwell into my mind at a constant berating rate I cannot stand nor still and it haunts me now I wish for it to be washed away like a pill that does not exist The tides of my emotions are going and going and I can t reach the bottom of the ocean or the apex of the day The night will come and I will hope for sleep Awaking through out the night several times How did I get here yet again Time after time I try for my best and I get lost upon the way Typing seems to help clear my mind and actually let the thoughts out I don t care if they can hear it This loud mechanical keyboard It is all I have for the moment Moment to moment I try and I try But the pain persists Elevation is felt like the breathe of wind upon a cool fall day I hope to be blanketed in the warmth of a fire I have yet to lit I must wait Waiting is no good I need it now That resolve That resolve of temptation removed from my spinal chord like a surgeon whose on his last chance Three strikes and your out No cancer I hope No disease or whatever Hoping will only get me so far I just have these moments Five days in and I wonder is this just me or is this just the nicotine Of course it is the nicotine Why do I let it get the best of me Why do I let it all get the best of me Taking away part of my soul and time here on earth Taking away from the joy of others as I mope around without any hope I must push through to the other side that I know exists I ve been there In a happy place in fulfillment with joy I like this place now One where I can finally have a conversation of sorts with myself it is better than the not talking The dreading of just existence Nothing brings me pleasure I am easily agitated Fuck smoking Fuck all of it I will not cave I will persist through this exist and I will conquer this addiction once more Let this be heard let it be forgotten Let it all go The suffering is not alone I must remember Millions before me millions to come The problems of the World are much more important than my temporary disdain of living Thoughts of ending it all rampant the mind from time to time No action will ever go with this wind I know because I know there is more to this More to this than dread or pain More than the failures of the past More than the burning desire to become addicted and hooked once more It is a phantasm ephemeral temporal I can see past its illusions It has no grasp over me Sure it weighs down the emotions and level of where I wish to be but wishing gets me nowhere Sleep is sleepless Existence just a passing burning sensation of pain Pain must go Addiction must go Nicotine must go Taking another puff Tempting into another vice These are not options they are ultimatums of death I choose life I will persist And so will all of us who are in the reapers grasp ,Day A needed journal rant of the mind,0

3289,Two years ago I had a hell of a flight delay and ended up going twelve hours between stepping into an airport terminal to landing at the wrong airport on the other side I was so irritable and fiending for a fix that I practically shoved my way out of the terminal asap and chain smoked like in a row before I was ready to think about anything else We had to stay overnight in the airport for an early flight home My non smoker friends wanted to go to the departing terminal to see if there was anything open to eat or a comfortable spot to sleep I was completely unwilling to lock myself in another terminal for more hours so I stayed near the front door by myself fuming at my friends for abandoning me Truth was that I chose the cigarettes over them That week I quit and haven t looked back I love keeping this subreddit in my feed because it s a constant reminder that I quit and how long it s been For those of you who ve quit stay strong my brother or sister For those of you looking to quit it s way better on the other side Best time to quit was the day you started second best time is right now Good luck and that s to all of you ,Nobody else will care but maybe y all might years cigarette free ,0

3293,I still get some cravings But in each case I can find that my desire to smoke would appear to be caused by anger acute stress frustration anxiety conflict and other generally negative feelings The other thing I would say is I have only had a couple of beers alcoholic drinks in these months If I had or more beers in the heat and stimulation overload of the city I m basically certain I d reach for one saying to myself it s only one ,I had my last cigarette on the th March Today is the th August So I haven t smoked a single cigarette in months ,0
3294,Since March I have been off and on quitting I went four months then went back when I started working Then april I quit again and went months but recently relapsed again I know work stress has to do with it and putting my exercise routine will help that work stress however the last time I quit I was highly emotional I had never cried so much in my life and I have never wanted to put all my walls up again I started trying to date people and open myself up to actually being with people despite the walls I wanted to put up The emotions started to get better because I was sharing my life with people and not living in isolation As I have relapsed a couple days ago I m realizing that I have begun isolating myself again I don t want to see anyone talk to anyone and I know that quitting will help this but it is my comfort zone I m so afraid of feeling every emotion again that I have been pushing down for the last ten years This is the first time quitting that I m less afraid of the physical withdraw than I am the flood of emotions that I am going to have to feel I know I need too and I m going to quit again because I do believe this could be the last time I have too but I am struggling with the emotions that I will be feeling I also still have many loved ones that smoke How do you deal with those relationships ,Emotions and Relationships when quitting ,0
3295,I quit almost a year ago to the day it was amazing how radically diffrent things became after I could smell for what felt like the first time in my life That dryer vent houses down glorious A dead animal on the side of the road long before I actually saw it glorious Some one well ahead of me wearing a strong perfume cologne glorious Then the financial stuff started pouring in I finally stopped living paycheck to pay check I became better financially minded in general when I was able to start seeing that money stack up I hit a radical savings goal in the last year thanks to not smoking I felt less impulsive in general I started trying to learn new things And started adopting a life style that I wanted instead of just coping with the one I had previously found myself in Then about months ago I decide having a cigarette at the bar while I had been drinking would be fine I just bummed off of people and had zero desire for one out side of inebriation I was in control things were great Then a friend of mine got a divorce and started staying out the house He would smoke at the house but I had been around plenty of people that smoked and the desire was just not there to I was in control We started going out a bit and I continued my habit of bumming while I was drunk but the more he was at the house and I d hang with him while he had a smoke the more tempted i became Fuck it I m in control Right I can totally have one or two with him itll be fine cause I m in control After a few weeks he was ready to go back home and I found myself with out any access to smokes Well I dont smoke any more so this is fine this is totally fine I m fine I m in control But just in case it s not fine lets go get a cigar from the corner store We ll just take a little hit every now and then when we really need to But maybe we need to like idk preemptively take that hit so it s not so bad when that craving show up It s ok cause we ll only have a few puff and it s only a cigar a day I m in control I ve got this I dont smoke any more I quit months ago Right At five cigars a day and the horrible feeling of my lungs I decide a pack of smokes might be the better option the nicotine head aches were killing me from the cigars and everyone knows cigars are way worse for you than cigarettes so I ll go with the healthy option I can totally manage to ration the cigarettes why better than the cigars I dont smoke any more cause you know I quit months ago I m back at a pack a day and have been for the past months and i cant stop thinking about how amazing that time not smoking was But i forget to remind myself how amazing it was and only think about how amazing that sweet sweet cigarette is about to be Most of my desire was gone within the first hours and by a week I hardly felt any thing The next hours are going to pass either way maybe I should try to just get through them smoke free ,My journey and where I m at now ,0
3296,Hey all I ll start by saying I m and from the UK but as many of you know getting fags is not very difficult I ve been smoking heavily for years now maybe or more a day the only change was I would start to run out of breath very easily and I m usually quite athletic normally However more problems have came around not able to go long walks cant run anywhere running out of money I get very very easily etc the usual I ve tried to stop before I got a vape however with my age I cant get any nicotine liquid and nobody really goes into a shop for it even then I was still needing a cigarette I wake up and the only thing on my mind is having one and not being able to function without it any other ways to stop that have helped others in the past I know you see posts like this constantly but uve tried NHS websites I ve tried talking to adults nothing works I really really want to stop but my brain keeps saying no Thanks ,Smoking really damaging me at a young age,0
3297,Hello everyone I ve decided to post about going one week Well it technically won t be one week until tonight at PM but the probability of me not getting there is and I won t have time to to an update tomorrow so now it is I made this post last Sunday https www reddit com r stopsmoking comments p mbpk advice and encouragement needed and got some great feedback I d like to specifically thank the people who informed me of the existence of Allen Carr s Easy Way I have tried to quit smoking so many different times and had no real success I listened to the audiobook and with a simple change of perspective quitting this time has been incredibly simple Even in my most successful quit in I always felt vulnerable to having another smoke falling back in wanting a puff of of someone s smoke if I was around it Now I don t even want one I didn t even want my last smoke when the book told me to have it I would legitimately recommend the easy way to anyone who needs to stop smoking It isn t painful or inconvenient Cravings are actually enjoyable because it s fun to starve that addiction out I don t want a cigarette my addiction does and if it doesn t get what it wants it dies Seriously cravings are fun and it is almost disappointing how quickly they disappear Not really of course because everything else improves so much Some changes I m noticing Days are long When you aren t constantly worried about time management or when and where you can get a cigarette in you have significantly more time to do things As mentioned in my first post I am a small business owner and am used to working hours per day Since cutting out smoking I haven t worked more than and I ve been getting more done than before This is an insane amount of gained efficiency at the cost of absolutely nothing I was worried about the first few days weeks months being hell while trying to kick nicotine It wasn t It s easy as long as you know that you don t want a smoke Just stop to smell your fingers every once in a while it s so much nicer when they don t smell like smoke amp x B I was not warned about the increase in energy I m not sure if this is going to stabilize or taper off in the coming weeks but it is inconsistent so far Day one and two were as usual Day three I was completely lethargic and actually couldn t get my work done at all I can t say for sure if that was related to smoking but it happened Day four I got up at am with a ton of energy and finished the work I d left from the previous day and easily caught back up Since then I have had the highest amount of energy I ve had in years Not in an panicked or twitchy way but in a wanting to enjoy things kind of way I ve started walking km miles every evening on top of my x per week workouts just because I want to And for me that is different because getting any exercise previously involved tremendous discipline Money savings obviously in a week it isn t that much but I have taken that amount and put it into a separate investment account I ve always been very into personal finance and good with money the irony of actually having to build my cigarettes into a budget for the past years and so I think with this in years I ll be able to buy something just fantastic when I retire I love the idea of getting a Ferrari with a license plate reading Smoke Free But we ll see I m not concerned about that too much but I will continue putting away this per week just to track the saved money more than the app and keep myself disciplined from replacing cigarettes with another expensive habit My house became a lot cleaner I don t just mean because I have all this extra time to give things a quick wipe and get the dishes put away faster that s happened too but the big one is there isn t cigarette mess anymore No ash on the deck that didn t make it into the ash tray no puts to deal with less dirty shoes walking through the house to get to the deck tracking dirt in etc I ve never really realized what a mess cigarettes made before this Everything about my surroundings is cleaner This goes double for the vehicles I didn t realize how infrequently this would cause me to go inside gas stations I ve come to the conclusion that the only people who physically enter gas stations more than x per month are people who only use cash buy lottery tickets or cigarettes And let me tell you I sure to not miss waiting behind those lottery ticket people I m trying to think of some other changes I ve noticed My breathing was always fine despite how much I used to smoke so I haven t really noticed an improvement there at least not a blatant one Still I can t imagine my lungs aren t a lot happier Overall I am yet to find a negative thing about quitting It s painless and easy if done the right way I wish I d been told that years ago If we re playing the hindsight game I d first liked to have never started and second would have liked to have been turned on to Allen Carr s way It might not work for everyone but it sure as hell did for me I m thankful to be off of cigarettes at years old One week sounds like premature celebration but I don t think it is I don t have any desire to smoke again Certainty is always scary but unless there s a gun to my head the chances of having another puff again are And maybe still even with that scenario I ll probably stop by and write more of these as I keep progressing to keep track of it It is because of this sub that I am not a smoker I hope I can help get a few other people there and a lot further than I am right now by doing so Thank you all so much ,One Week Update,0
